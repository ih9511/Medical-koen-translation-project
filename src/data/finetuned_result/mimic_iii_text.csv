Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ y/o male with a hx of HTN, DM2, dylipidemia, 
recent CVA ___ who presented from OSH for further management of 
change in mental status.
.
1) Change in Mental Status: His mental status waxed and waned 
which was most consistent with a delerium. He was recenlty 
treated for a UTI (recent hospitalization) and was noted to have 
an elevated creatinine which normalized with fluids. His sodium 
was also been noted to be elevated which corrected with fluids 
as well. He also had multiple med changes as well as interuppted 
sleep which all may have contributed to his change in mental 
status. As for a neurological cause, he has no new focal 
neurological deficits although neuro exam was difficult to 
assess (stable left sided weakness ___ to recent stroke). He had 
no fevers, cough, meningismus or dysuria therefore infection was 
less likley. As for other metabolic causes, he has been 
extensively worked up at outside hospitals which have all been 
negative. His urine was found to be growing enterococcus 
10,000-100,000 which was treated with a 7 day course of 
augmentin. As per neurology they felt that EEG was consistent 
with toxic/metabolic and not seizure. After discussion with 
family LP was felt not to be indicated. After an extensive 
workup it was unclear why he continued to have delerium. Based 
on recent events his mental status was most likley due to recent 
stroke.
.
2) Nutrition: He was noted to have decreased PO intake. He was 
refusing his medications and was not eating. Nutrition was 
consulted and they advanced his diet to regular solid foods with 
thin liquids. They recommended a chin tuck, 1 sip at a time with 
2 swallows. Please encourage family to encourage patient to take 
in oral intake.
.
3) MCA Stroke: According to admission notes his neuro exam had 
not changed. He has baseline residual left sided weakness. Left 
arm weakness is most prominent.
.
4) Hypernatremia: He was noted to have an elevated sodium which 
was thought to be secondary to poor PO intake. He received D5W 
and his sodium improved. He was encouraged to take in as much PO 
(free water) intake. However, despite this he developed 
hypernatremia. Please check sodium every 3 days and correct with 
D5W. 
.
5) HTN: He was restarted on his home medications. He was 
continued on metoprolol, Lisinopril and Valsartan
.
6) Anemia: He was noted to have a macrocytic anemia however his 
folate and B12 were within normal limits. ___ be secondary to 
chronic renal insufficiency.
.
7) Left Hand Pain ___ MCP): He has a history of gout and his 
presentation was consistent with a gout flare. He denies any 
fevers, chills or night sweats. He was given a one time dose of 
colchicine 0.6mg. If gout persists may repeat 0.6 once.

병력 개시 :
최근 오른쪽 MCA 뇌졸중을 입고 두 달 전 직접적으로 OSH로 이송되었다. 간헐적인 발작으로 인해 간호를 받았다. 이전에 우측 팔 손발 및 다리 약화가 있었다. 부모는 최근의 우측 MCA뇌졀전 후 왼손 주먹와 다리가 약간 약해졌다고 했다. 산소 치료제인 옥시코돈과 로피니롤을 시작했다. 아들이 보았듯이 반구형 운동이 더 많다. 이후 환자는 병력이 있다. OSH에서 2개월 전에 환자가 발생했으며, 그때도 환자의 정신 상태는 정상이었다. 환자는 또한 일부 기저질환을 가지고 있었지만 가족 구성원이 본 적은 없었다. 환인은 또한 불면증을 앓고 있으며, 환인의 정신 상태 변화를 관리하기 위해 산소치료제와 로피노릴을 계속 사용하고 있다. 환인이 복용한 것은 전체 ADL였다. 환이는 또한 몇 시간 동안 잠들었으나, 환아에게는 그렇지 않았다. 환아는 또한 환부의 신경학적 검사를 통해 확인하였다. 환사는 또한 혈액검사에서 알 수 없는 부분이 발견되었는데, 이는 환아의 행동이다. 환은 또한 환아가 지속적으로 혼란스러웠던 이유는 환아 때문이라고 한다. 환이가 환아를 데리고 갔을 때 환아 역시 환아 때문에 혼란 스럽다는 것을 느꼈다. 환하는 또한 환자를 데려왔고, 환가는 환아로부터 도움을 받아야 한다고 생각한다. 환지는 또한 환인을 데리고 가서 환아와 함께 일할 수 있는 능력을 갖추었다. 환이나 환아 모두 환아에 대해 잘 알고 있음을 보여준다. 환나는 또한 환이를 데리고 갈 필요성이 있다고 생각하며, 환이는 환아 없이도 환아처럼 행동할 수 있을 것이다. 환시는 또한 환자가 환아보다 먼저 사망했다. 환치는 또한 환이가 죽어버렸다고 말했고, 환은 환아로서의 역할을 수행해야 할 것으로 여겨졌다. 환기는 또한 환사가 환아였기에 환아나 환아 둘 다 환아라고 말했다. 환사의 경우 환아뿐만 아니라 환아도 환안을 데리고 가지 않을 것이며, 환이가 생존하지 못하면 환아라도 환아라 하겠다. 환스는 또한 환기가 환아이고, 환이 환아라는 사실을 인정받으려고 노력했다. 그러나 환아들은 환아들을 데리고가지 않으면 안 된다. 환년에는 또한 환가를 데리고갈 필요성을 느끼게 되었다. 환에는 또한 환수가 환아임에도 불구하고 환아들도 환아들과 같은 행동을 하는 것 같다. 환이 또한 환상을 경험하였으며, 환리는 또한 환애를 데려왔다. 환재는 또한 유방암을 앗고있다. 하지만 환아들에게는 환이가 아닌 다른 사람들의 존재가 없다. 환에서는 또한 환앙을 데려갔다. 환량은 또한 유산을 겪었다. 하지만 유방 암은 환년에겐 없어서 환아들이 환아랑 같이 행동하도록 만들었다. 따라서 환은 유방염을 앟고 있다. 하지만 이는 환의 과거에 대한 설명이며, 환의 현재 상황은 환의 상태를 나타내는 것이다."

imaging: 
___
CT c-spine:
1. No acute fracture of the cervical spine. 
2. Grade 1 anterolisthesis of C2 on C3 and C3 on C4 which may be 

degenerative, although this cannot be confirmed without prior 
studies. Grade 1 retrolisthesis of C4 over C5 with mild kyphosis 
and moderate canal stenosis. 
3. Moderate spinal canal stenosis at C4-5 and C5-C6, which could 
predispose the patient to cord injury in the setting of minor 
trauma. MRI is recommended for further assessment of cord or 
ligamentous injury, provided the patient has no 
contraindications to MRI. 

___
CT Head:
No acute intracranial hemorrhage or edema. No acute skull 
fracture, within the limitations of slight motion.  

___
CT abdomen/pelvis/chest:
1. Moderate to large right pneumothorax with a small component 
of 
hydropneumothorax.  
2. Large hiatal hernia containing fluid. Fluid in the entire 
esophagus, 
placing the patient at risk for aspiration. 
3. Emphysema. 
4. Posterior right rib fractures 5 through 11. 
5. Multiple compression deformities of the thoracic and lumbar 
spine as 
detailed above, age indeterminate. 
6. Extensive subcutaneous gas of the neck, abdomen, pelvis and 
right arm.  
Pneumomediastinum.  
7. Diverticulosis, no evidence of diverticulitis. 

___ EKG:
Sinus rhythm. Low QRS voltage. Consider prior inferior 
myocardial infarction. Prior anterior myocardial infarction. 
Since the previous tracing of ___ delayed R wave progression 
is more prominent but there may be no significant change. 

___ echocardiogram:
The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
unusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is 
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a 
focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is 
a mid-cavitary LV systolic gradient, which increases with the 
Valsalva maneuver. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid 
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary 
artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which 
most likely represents a promient fat pad. 

IMPRESSION: Small, hypertrophied and hyperdynamic left ventricle 
with a mid-cavitary gradient. Moderate pulmonary hypertension

___ CXR 
No pneumothoraces are seen on either side. There is again seen a 
very large hiatal hernia which is less air-filled. There are 
bilateral pleural 
effusions, right side worse than left, which are unchanged from 
prior. There are no signs for overt pulmonary edema. There is 
demineralization of the thoracic spine with some compression 
deformities. 

microbiology: 
___ Stool Clostridium difficile culture - negative 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Trauma Surgical Service after 
transfer from the OSH. She was s/p fall with multiple right rib 
fractures and right pneumothorax. The chest tubes were placed to 
suction. She also had lumbar and thoracic spinal compression 
fractures which were non-operative; neurosurgery was consulted. 
She was initially admitted to the surgical trauma ICU for 
monitoring of her respiratory status. The patient was 
hemodynamically stable.

Neuro: Initially pain service was consulted regarding epidural 
anasthesia. However, that was not done, and instead the patient 
received IV morphine with good effect and adequate pain control. 
She also recieved a transdermal lidocaine patch to the chest. 
She recieved Tylenol and Toradol. On ___, she was strated on 
PCA dilaudid. When tolerating oral intake, the patient was 
transitioned to oral pain medications, namely in liquid form and 
that was easier for her to tolerate. Pain service was involved 
to manage pain. 

CV: The patient remained stable from a cardiovascular 
standpoint; vital signs were routinely monitored. Cardiac 
anzymes were monitored multiple times and were negative. The EKG 
was performed on ___, which was not suspicious for acute 
ischemia. The echo was done on ___, the results are detailed 
in the previous section. 

Pulmonary: Patient was admitted with the right pneumothorax and 
subcutaneous emphasema along the right lateral chest wall and 
flank extending inferiorly to about right anterior superior 
iliac spine. At the time of admission she had one chest tube 
placed and later on the same day she had a second chest tube 
placed to suction. Good pulmonary toilet, early ambulation and 
incentive spirrometry were encouraged throughout 
hospitalization. She recieved albuterol and ipratropium as 
needed for shortness of breath. Both of the two chest tube were 
removed on ___, patient experienced some 
respiratory distress on ___ she had small apical pneumothorax 
on CXR. The respiratory distress was treated with nebulizers, 
cpap and diuresis. Her repiratory status was monitored in the 
trauma ICU until ___, when she was transferred to the floor. 
Two days later she experienced respiratory distress and was 
transferred back to the ICU on ___. Subsequntly, patient was 
intubated in the ICU and chest tube was placed on the right 
side. She continued to have an air leak, the chest tube stayed 
to suction. Treatment with vancomycin and cefepime were started 
for presumed pneumonia. Patient's respiratory status improved 
and she was extubated on ___ and transferred to the floor. 

She did well on the floor, even though she had a persistent air 
leak. Attempts were made to clamp the chest tube, she initially 
did not tolerate it. The pleurodesis was done by thoracic 
surgery service at bedside. Patient tolerated it well. Several 
days later, the air leak largely disappeared, patient eventually 
tolerated clamping and chest tube to water seal for almost 48 
hours. The chest tube was then removed and patient remained in 
good respiratory status with no residual pneumothorax on chest 
x-ray. Patient recieved daily chest x-rays to monitor her right 
sided pneumothorax. 

By the time of discharge patient was on her home dose on 
supplemental oxygen, sating well over 92%.  

GI/GU/FEN: Post-operatively, the patient was made NPO with IV 
fluids. Diet was advanced when appropriate, which was well 
tolerated. Patient's intake and output were closely monitored, 
and IV fluid was adjusted when necessary. Electrolytes were 
routinely followed, and repleted when necessary. 

Patient was kept NPO initially secondary to large hiatal hernia 
and concern for aspiration risk. She had a speech and swallow 
evaluation on ___. The recommendations were diet of thin 
liquids and pureed consistency solids, medications to be crushed 
with the liquids, one on one supervision and nutrition consult 
was recommended. Recommended diet was started following this 
evaluation. 

ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. She remained afebrile. 
The sputum cultures were sent once, but contained only 
respiratory flora. Patient was treated with vancomycin and 
cefepime for presumed pneumonia. 

Stool was sent on ___ for Clostridium difficile analysis. There 
was no growth. 

Endocrine: The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
his stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly.

Hematology: The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required. Her anemia was at 
baseline. 

Prophylaxis: The patient received subcutaneous heparin and 
venodyne boots were used during this stay; was encouraged to get 
up and ambulate as early as possible with physical therapy.

At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs. The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet with supplements, ambulating with assisstance, voiding, and 
pain was well controlled. Her respiratory status was much 
improved and stable, at her baseline. The patient received 
discharge teaching and follow-up instructions with understanding 
verbalized and agreement with the discharge plan.

10.5 minutes of a modified ___ protocol representing an 
average 
exercise tolerance for his age; ~ ___ METS. The exercise test 
was 
stopped due to progressive shortness of breath and leg fatigue. 
Prior to 
exercise, the patient reported mild anterior chest burning that 
he 
reportedly woke up with and improved with breakfast and calcium 
carbonate. This discomfort did not change in intensity during 
the 
procedure. Early post-exercise the patient reported a mild 
(___) 
left-sided chest tightness which resolved slowly with rest and 
was 
absent 10 minutes post-exercise. The patient also reported neck 
and 
throat discomfort post-exercise that improved and was absent by 
10 
minutes post-exercise. No significant ST segment changes were 
noted 
during the procedure. The rhythm was sinus with rare isolated 
APBs and 
one atrial couplet. Rare isolated VPBs were also noted. The 
hemodynamic 
response to exercise was appropriate.

간단한 입원 과정 :
Mr. ____ was transferred from outside hospital where he underwent cardiac cath showing severe three-vessel CAD. See operative note. Following surgery, he was taken care of in ICU for close monitoring in stable state. Later today, he woke up neurologially intact and was extubat ed. On POD 1, he began beta blockers and diur etics and gradually diureses back to his prep weight. Today, he went through telemetry floor. Chest tubes and epicordial pacing wires removed according to protocols. Physical therapy helped him regain strength and mobility throughout recovery. He developed postradiation atrial fibrillation and converted to sinus rhythm using lopressors and amiodarones. Coumadins weren’t initiated because he’s considered a high-risk individual. Rest"

REPORTS
CARDIAC CATH ___
COMMENTS:      
1. Selective coronary angiography in this right dominant system 
demonstrated three vessel disease. The LMCA has no 
angiographically 
apparent disease. The LAD had a total occlusion in the proximal 
portion 
of the vessel and a diagonal with an 80% mid vessel stenosis. 
The Cx had 
a total proximal occlusion. The RCA had a total proximal 
occlusion. 
2. Limited resting hemodynamics revealed elevated right and left 
sided 
filling pressures with an RVEDP of 14mmHg and an LVEDP of 
21mmHg. The 
Pulmonary pressures were moderately elevated with a PASP of 
44mmHg. The 
cardiac index was preserved at 2.2 l/min/m2. There was a 60mmHg 
gradient 
from the LV to the aorta on pullback of the catheter. The 
central aortic 
pressure was noted to be 143/44 mmHg. 
3. Limited arterial conduit arteriography revealed an SVG to OMB 
that 
had a 40-50% ostial stenosis. The SVG to PDA had a 60-70% 
stenosis in 
the mid portion of the SVG. The RPDA was a very large vessel and 

provided collaterals to the Cx distribution. The SVG to Diagonal 
had a 
90% ostial stenosis with slow flow into the diagonal branch. The 

diagonal branch had collateral from the LAD. The LIMA to the LAD 
was 
widely patent and the LAD was a small vessel in caliber. 
  
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:     
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease. 
2. Severe aortic stenosis. 
3. Moderate diastolic ventricular dysfunction. 
4. Moderate pulmonary hypertension. 
.
CT Chest w/o contrast ___
FINDINGS: 
The patient is after median sternotomy and CABG. The appearance 
of the 
sternum is unremarkable with no evidence of dehiscence. There 
are several 
bypass grafts noted, at least two originating from the ascending 
aorta.  
Descending aorta is normal in diameter, not exceeding 3 cm. 
Calcifications 
involve the entire ascending aorta and starts approximately 7 cm 
above the 
aortic valve. The extent of calcification is more pronounced at 
the anterior circumference of the aorta than at the posterior 
part. There is a small gap between the superior end of the 
calcifications and the first bypass graft, approximately 1.5 cm 
in diameter. The aortic arch and descending aorta are calcified 
as well. The aortic valve is heavily calcified. The diameter of 
the pulmonary arteries is unremarkable. Native coronary arteries 
are extremely calcified. Heart size is normal. There is a 
relative bulging of the cardiac apex that potentially may 
represent a prior myocardial infarct of the apex of the left 
ventricle. The imaged portion of the upper abdomen demonstrates 
calcified abdominal aorta, atrophic changes in the pancreas. 
Several mediastinal lymph nodes are 
not pathologically enlarged. The airways are patent to the level 
of subsegmental bronchi bilaterally. Diffuse bronchial wall 
thickening is noted, bilaterally, mostly in the upper lungs. 
Those findings in conjunction with multiple centrilobular 
nodules might be consistent with respiratory bronchiolitis/viral 
infection. Superior segment of right lower lobe subpleural 
lesion, 4:90, is 10 x 7 mm in diameter and most likely 
represents atelectasis, but would require further followup to 
exclude the possibility of neoplasm. A right hilar calcified 
lymph nodes as well as right lower lobe calcified granuloma are 
consistent with prior ranulomatous exposure. Bibasilar linear 
opacities most likely representing 
areas of atelectasis. Left upper lobe posterior nodule, is 2.5 
cm in 
diameter, 4:75, a lingular nodule is calcified, 4:113. There is 
no pleural or pericardial effusion demonstrated. Extensive 
degenerative changes are present in the thoracic spine. There 
are no bone lesions worrisome for infection or neoplasm.  
IMPRESSION: 
1. Extensive calcifications of the ascending aorta as described 
in detail in the body of the report. 
2. Status post CABG with at least two bypasses originating from 
the ascending aorta. 
3. Extensive calcifications of native coronary arteries and 
aortic valve.  
Questionable prior myocardial infarct involving the left 
ventricular apex. 
4. Suspected respiratory bronchiolitis/infectious process in the 
upper lungs, correlate if history of smoking is present. 
5. Superior segment of right lower lobe atelectasis versus 
nodule, should be evaluated in three months for documentation of 
stability/resolution.

ECHO ___
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. There is mild global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF 
= 45 %). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left 
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular 
chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets are severely thickened/deformed. There is critical 
aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.5 cm2). Mild to moderate 
(___) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets 
are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. 
Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic 
shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be 
significantly UNDERestimated.] The left ventricular inflow 
pattern suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion. 
 
.
Carotid series ___ Final Report 
Study: Carotid Series Complete 
___ year old man s/p CABG, with worsening AS, work-up for 
AVR.. 
Findings: Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid 
arteries. On
the right there is bulky heterogeneous plaque in the ICA and 
ECA. On the left there is significant heterogeneous plaque in 
the ICA and a tiny plaque in the ECA. Both CCA waveforms are 
blunted consistent with know AS. 
On the right systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA 
proximal, mid and distal respectively are 93/10, 76/15, 77/17, 
cm/sec. CCA peak systolic 
velocity is 86 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 107 cm/sec. 
The ICA/CCA ratio is 1.0. These findings are consistent with 
<40% stenosis. 
On the left systolic/end diastolic velocities of the ICA 
proximal, mid and 
distal respectively are 479/105, 223/39, 144/39, cm/sec. CCA 
peak systolic 
velocity is 77 cm/sec. ECA peak systolic velocity is 147 cm/sec. 
The ICA/CCA ratio is 6.2. These findings are consistent with 
80-99% stenosis. 
There is antegrade right vertebral artery flow. There is 
antegrade left vertebral artery flow. 
Impression: Right ICA stenosis <40%. Left ICA stenosis 80-99%  
.

Past Medical History:
PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:  
As per last ___ clinic note:
Mr. ___ PSA had risen from 3.2 in ___ to 6.5 in
___, 7.0 in ___, and 9.1 in ___. This
prompted a referral to Dr. ___ performed transrectal
ultrasound-guided biopsy ___. Pathology from 20 cores showed
___ 4+3 disease involving a core from the right base with 
70%
of submitted tissue involved, ___ 3+4 disease involving 
cores
from the right mid prostate and right mid base with ___ of
submitted tissue involved, and ___ 3+3 disease involving 15%
of a core from the left base.  Additionally, there was an
atypical glandular focus in a core from the right mid prostate.  


Bone Scan ___ showed degenerative thoracic spine disease 
but
no bony metastases. Prostate MRI ___ showed a 50.5
mL prostate.  There was a large area of low signal on 
T2-weighted
images in the left superior central gland with abnormal kinetics
suggestive of central tumor.  There was also a large area of
low-signal intensity in the right base extending into midline 
and
left superiorly and into the base of the seminal vesicles also
demonstrating abnormal kinetics.  There were also two additional
small foci in the right apex with suspicious kinetics.  This was
consistent with T3b disease and worrisome for central tumor in
the left superior central gland.

He was treated by Dr. ___ with 4500 cGy EBRT to the
prostate and seminal vesicles and ___ cGy CyberKnife to the
prostate and proximal seminal vesicles. No ADT was given due to
comorbid cardiac disease and lack of evidence for additional
efficacy in combination with the above radiation therapy. He
received radiation from ___ - ___.

Following radiation, his PSA decreased to 1.3 by ___.
However, it immediately began to rise thereafter. It increased 
by
almost 2 ng/mL about a year later, ___.
Bone scan ___ showed no bony metastases. Prostate MRI 
___
showed diffuse T2 signal abnormality
throughout the peripheral zone, demonstrating progressive
enhancement, likely representing post-treatment changes without
definite evidence for tumor.  However, there was an 8-mm left
external iliac node, which had previously been 3 mm and was
suspicious for nodal disease.

He was treated with CyberKnife to the external iliac lymph node
___ - ___. Follow-up CT showed resolution of this
lymphadenopathy. However, his PSA returned at 19.7 on ___, 
so
he was referred for evaluation for ADT. We initially evaluated
him on ___ and started him on a 4-week depot injections of
Lupron. 

For a while he was on intermittent Lupron but his PSA was rising
and he had some metastatic disease that shrunk on the Lupron and
now he is on continuous ADT.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you in the hospital. You were 
admitted because you had clots in your lungs and legs. You were 
seen by the vascular team who specializes in treating clots. You 
were started on a medication called Xarelto and you will need to 
take this twice a day with food for 21 days, then you will take 
20 mg once a day. Please follow up with your primary care doctor 
within the next week. You will need to stop your home blood 
pressure medications because your heart rate was consistently 
lower than 60 while you were here. Please talk to your PCP about 
whether you need a different blood pressure medication.

.
___ SUPINE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:
Low lung volumes are present. The heart is enlarged with left 
ventricular configuration. The aorta is unfolded and 
demonstrates aortic knob calcifications. Crowding of pulmonary 
vascular structures is demonstrated, likely result of low lung 
volumes. No focal consolidation, pleural effusions, or definite 
pneumothorax is present.
.
___ ECHO Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity 
size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is 
mildly depressed (LVEF= 50 %) with inferolateral akinesis. The 
ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets 
(3) are mildly thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. 
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral 
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern 
suggests impaired relaxation. The tricuspid valve leaflets are 
mildly thickened. There is borderline pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
1.) C1 fracture & Nasal fracture: 
Patient was evaluated by orthopedic surgery upon presentation. 
They recommended a ___ cervical collar for 6 weeks total 
with orthopedics follow-up with Dr. ___ in 3 o 4 weeks time. 
Did not present with any neurological deficits. Patient was put 
on standing tylenol dosing for pain prevention. Vitamin D 
supplements were started during the hospitalization.
<br>
2.) S/p fall: 
History is indicative of mechanical fall from wheelchair. 
Cardiac work-up was not pursued given the patient's reliable 
history of reaching forward from wheelchair and falling on her 
forehead. Initial concern for dehydration, so patient was given 
intravenous fluids. Given that the patient typically uses a 
wheelchair for ambulation, physical therapy was not pursued as 
an inpatient. She should receive physical therapy at her nursing 
facility.
<br> 
3. Hypoxia: 
Patient was hypoxic to 85% on RA in the ED, thought originally 
to be secondary to body habitus and cervical collar. CXR 
negative for pneumonia. After two days of unsuccessful attempts 
to liberate patient from supplemental oxygen, we requested an 
echocardiogram which showed a LVEF 50%, moderate mitral regurg, 
diastolic dysfunction. Patient was given a one time dose of 
Lasix 20 mg IV on evening prior to discharge and had a brisk 
urine output in response. Her BP remained stable, as did her 
renal function with discharge creatinine of 0.6. Oxygen 
saturation on room air the morning of discharge was 93%. The 
patient should address this underlying hypoxia with her PCP.
<br>  
4. UTI: 
Patient had positive UA at presentation, so was given 
ceftriaxone in ED. Was then switched to Cipro 250 mg Q12H for 
UTI Has completed therapy at discharge.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ who presented to ___ s/p mechanical 
fall from standing and was found on imaging to have four 
displaced left-sided rib fractures. He denies any ___ or 
LOC. The patient was admitted to the Trauma service for pain 
control and pulmonary toilet.  The Acute Pain Service (APS) was 
consulted for epidural placement.

On HD1, the patient had an episode of Afib vs Aflutter w/ RVR 
responsive to Metoprolol 5mg IV x1. APS placed a thoracic 
epidural. The patient was initially called out to the floor 
however after starting epidural infusion with bupi + dilaudid, 
the patient became agitated/delirious and pulling at lines, 
trying to get out of bed, with AMS thought to be exacerbated by 
dilaudid.  The epidural was switched to plain bupi which was 
effective and the patient had no further episodes of agitation. 
Trazadone 50mg was provided for sleep. Due to c/f agitation and 
elevated HRs, the patient remained in the ICU. Cardiology was 
curbsided re: new onset Afib, thought likely to be Afib vs 2:1 
Aflutter, and recommended beta-blockade and nonurgent medicine 
consult once on floor to discuss systemic AC. It was recommended 
he follow-up with his PCP for this issue. Pain well controlled 
on thoracic epidural with bupiviciane.  

On HD2, the patient's pain remained well-controlled.  He was 
started on PO Lopressor w/ IV for breakthrough, HR continued to 
be in 100s.  The patient was upset that he could not leave, 
stood up from chair and fell with back against the wall at 1800, 
witnessed by nurse, ___, no LOC, mental status at 
baseline directly subsequent to the event, no new bruises or 
deformities on head/neck/back so was not worked up further.  He 
continued to retain urine requiring intermittent straight 
catheterization, started on tamsulosin qHS. Flu swab repeated, 
positive.  

On HD3, APS recommended continuing the epidural given 
delirium/agitation with narcotics in past and no other good 
options for pain control, IS. ___ worked with the patient.  The 
patient was transferred to the surgical floor.

On HD4, the epidural was capped and then later removed.  The 
patient reported minimal pain and received tramadol and 
acetaminophen prn for pain control.  The patient worked with 
Physical Therapy and was approved for discharge home with home 
___.  At the time of discharge, the patient was hemodynamically 
stable, tolerating a regular diet and pain was well-controlled.  
He was discharged home in stable condition.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to ___ after 
a fall and you were found to have multiple left-sided rib 
fractures.  You were admitted to the Trauma Surgery service for 
pain control and to monitor your breathing.  You had an epidural 
placed by the Acute Pain service for pain control and you were 
transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).  You also tested 
positive for the flu and were placed on droplet precautions.  

After remaining stable in the ICU, you were transferred to the 
surgical floor.  Your epidural was removed and you were started 
on oral pain medication.  Your pain is now controlled with oral 
pain medication and your ability to take deep breaths has 
improved.  You have worked with Physical Therapy and it is 
recommended that you be discharged home with home physical 
therapy services.  You also will have home visiting nursing 
services. 

You are now ready to be discharged home to continue your 
recovery.  Please note the following discharge instructions:

Rib Fractures:

* Your injury caused left-sided rib fractures which can cause 
severe pain and subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths 
because of the pain.
 
* You should take your pain medication as directed to stay ahead 
of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep breaths. If 
the pain medication is too sedating take half the dose and 
notify your physician.
 
* Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures.  In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake.  This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs.
 
* You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.
 
* Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.
 
* Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.
 
* Do NOT smoke
 
* If your doctor allows, non-steroidal ___ drugs 
are very effective in controlling pain ( ie, Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.
 
* Return to the Emergency Room right away for any acute 
shortness of breath, increased pain or crackling sensation 
around your ribs (crepitus).

Influenza Instructions: Seek medical attention if: 
 fever rises to ___ F (39.4 C) or higher
 the fever accompanied by sweating
 you experience chills and a cough with colored phlegm
 you have significantly swollen glands
 you feel severe sinus pain

Transesophageal Echocardiogram ___
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is 
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and 
regional/global systolic function (LVEF>55%). There is no 
ventricular septal defect. Right ventricular chamber size and 
free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the 
sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is 
moderate/severe posterior leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Torn 
mitral chordae are present. An eccentric, anteriorly directed 
jet of Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is seen. Due 
to the eccentric nature of the regurgitant jet, its severity may 
be significantly underestimated (Coanda effect). The estimated 
pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

CT CHEST ___
1. Heavy atherosclerotic calcification is identified at the 
aortic arch and
along the descending aorta.
2. Diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening may reflect 
bronchitis, infectious or inflammatory.
3. Moderate emphysema.
4. A 3 mm solid nodule in the right upper lobe does not require 
follow-up
unless patient has high risk of malignancy, in which case 12 
month followup
chest CT is recommended.

Pulmonary Function Tests ___
Severe obstructive ventilatory defect with evidence of gas 
trapping. The reduced DLCO suggests an emphysematous process. 
There are no prior studies available for comparison.

Transesophageal Echocardiogram ___
The left atrium is dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 
2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function 
is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic 
function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular 
regurgitation.] with normal free wall contractility. There are 
simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet 
excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The 
mitral valve leaflets are myxomatous. There is severe P2 eaflet 
mitral valve prolapse resulting in moderate to severe (3+) 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation vena 
contracta is >=0.7cm. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Tricuspid valve prolapse is present. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Severe P2 mitral valve prolapse with moderate to 
severe mitral regurgitation.  

Cardiac Catheterization ___
Dominance: Right
LMCA: normal
LAD: normal
LCX: dominant and normal
RCA: small, non-dominant vessel with no significant disease

Transesophageal Echocardiogram (intraoperative) ___
PREBYPASS
No spontaneous echo contrast is seen in the body of the left 
atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen 
by 2D or color Doppler. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are 
normal. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall 
left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). 
[Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more 
depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic 
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is 
not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate/severe p2 leaflet mitral valve prolapse. Moderate to 
severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no 
pericardial effusion. Dr. ___ was notified in person 
of the results on ___ in the operating room. 

POSTBYPASS
Patient is receiving an infusion of Phenylephrine. LVEF= 45

CT Chest ___
1. Post mitral valve replacement with extensive subcutaneous 
emphysema and 
nonhemorrhagic mediastinal fluid collection, which cannot be 
completely 
assessed without intravenous contrast. 
2. Large left pneumothorax, increased in size since chest 
radiograph this 
morning, and moderate right pneumothorax, despite the presence 
of multiple 
chest tubes.  Bilateral pigtail and possibly the left laterally 
entering chest tubes terminate within the lung parenchyma. 
3. Extensive airspace consolidation in the left lung likely 
hemorrhage and 
atelectasis, possibly pneumonia. 
4. Small left greater than right pleural effusions likely 
unchanged from 
radiograph earlier this morning. 
5. Pulmonary hypertension. 

CT Chest ___
1.  Emphysema is not optimally assessed in the setting of 
widespread acute 
parenchymal lung disease. With this limitation in mind, 
emphysema is at least moderate in severity, demonstrates 
predominantly centrilobular features, and upper lung 
predominance. 
2. Decrease in size of left pneumothorax with small residual 
pneumothorax 
remaining. 
3. Increase in size of right pneumothorax with moderate residual 
pneumothorax remaining. 
4.  Worsening multifocal airspace consolidation in the left 
upper lobe and 
lingula is concerning for multifocal pneumonia in the 
appropriate clinical 
setting. Worsening partial collapse of the right lower lobe. 
5.  Decrease in extent of subcutaneous emphysema.

Brief Hospital Course:
 ASSESSMENT AND PLAN  
 ___ yo woman w/ severe COPD, mitral valve prolapse, at least 
moderate mitral regurgitation with new diagnoses of pulmonary 
hypertension and congestive heart failure 64% who presents for 
high risk TEE evaluation w/ anesthesia for her worsening MR and 
potential evaluation for surgical treatment.  
 
 # Mitral insufficiency- Pt needed to undergo TEE at OSH, but it 
was considered a high risk procedure because of her resting 
hypoxia (currently sating 87-92%RA) as well as advanced COPD. It 
was suggested that she should get this procedure at a tertiary 
care ___ so she was directed to ___. She underwent TEE 
which showed severe mitral regurgitation. She was felt to be a 
candidate for valve replacement surgery pending pulmonary 
evaluation and was transferred to the CT surgery service after 
patient reached euvolemia. 
 
 # diastolic CHF- EF from last ECHO 64%. Moderate MR noted 
___ of which could be underestimated ___ eccentricity). 
Recent significant increase in BLE edema over the last 3 months, 
worse than it ever has been in her life, which has gradually 
improved w/ home diuresis, but she is still fluid overloaded on 
exam. Per pt she has been on Lasix for the last ___ yrs for BLE 
edema, and on ___ visited cardiologist who changed her diuretic 
from furosemide 40AM and 20PM to torsemide 20 BID + 
spironolactone 12.5 daily.  She was diuresed with IV lasix and 
then transitioned to torsemide PO. Patient had RHC that 
demonstrated RA pressure of 7 mmHg prior to surgery. She 
remained euvolemic until transfer to CT surgery. 

 # COPD - Per PFTs from ___, moderate obstructive 
dysfunction with evidence for hyperinflation and air trapping. 
The patient has a low resting saturation of 91% and dropped to a 
low of 86% during recovery after walking 100 feet. Compared to 
PFTs from ___, FEV1 has dropped from 72% of predicted -> 64% of 
predicted. There was similar hyperinflation and worse air 
trapping in ___. Exercise oximetry has worsened. The lowest 
saturation with walking 500 feet in ___ was 92%. Of note, the 
respiratory therapist states the patient refused home oxygen 
setup after the most recent PFTs.  Patient received PFTs in 
hospital, which demonstrated improved FEV1. She was felt after 
testing to meet risk parameters to proceed with valve surgery. 
  
 # CAD- Evidence of mild inferior wall ischemia on nuclear 
stress ___, but she has never been cathed. Pt has no symptoms 
of angina, but has some exertional SOB, unchanged over the last 
3 months. Pt was on aspirin once upon a time but self d/ced 
because she was on too many pills, per her. Her home simvastatin 
was continued and an aspirin was added to her regimen daily.
  
 # Pulmonary hypertension- Pt has new diagnosis of pHTN on 
recent ECHO, which could be secondary to COPD, to mitral valve 
disease, or diastolic CHF.

Postoperative Cardiac Surgery Course:
___
The patient was admitted to the hospital and brought to the 
operating room on ___ where the patient underwent MV repair 
and ring with 30mm ___ II ring, neo cord x 3. Had 
re-exploration in the OR.  Please see operative note for 
details. Post-operatively was transferred to the CVICU in stable 
condition for recovery and invasive monitoring.  She arrived 
from the OR intubated on phenylephrine and vasopressin. POD 1 
found the patient extubated, alert and oriented and breathing 
comfortably.  The patient was neurologically intact and 
hemodynamically stable and weaned off inotropic or vasopressor 
support. She had persistent air leak from CTs. Pressor therapy 
was restarted on POD2. She developed significant subcutaneous 
air and required emergent reintubation. Bilateral pneumothoraces 
noted on CXR. Bilateral CTs placed, left CT placed by thoracic 
service. Right pigtail by cardiac surgery. Patient has a history 
of COPD. She had persistent air leaks ongoing left pneumothorax, 
necessitating the placement of left pigtail. She had f/u Chest 
CT which showed large left pneumo and intraparenchymal pigtails 
which were removed after placement of #28 left Chest tube. She 
was successfully weaned and extubated.
Persistent air leaks despite 4 CT system. High O2 requirement, 
aggressive pulmonary toileting. CTs weaned and managed by the IP 
and thoracic services.  Final CT was d/c'd on ___.  During 
her hospital course she was found to have H-flu and was treated 
with 14 day course of IV ceftriaxone (end date ___. She 
remained stable from a pulmonary standpoint. She continues to 
have an oxygen requirement of 5L NC to maintain sats 89-95%. Her 
O2 sat decreases to 70""s on room air when she removes her 
oxygen. Her oxygen saturation recovers quickly when the oxygen 
is replaced. She is asymptomatic during these episodes. 

She has history of anxiety and was restarted in pre-op Xanax and 
pre-op oxycontin. She was doing well for the initial days of her 
recovering but after her ___ extubation she developed post-op 
delirium requiring Haldol. She was aggressively diuresed. Stable 
renal function. She developed thrombocytopenia that has since 
resolved. She developed H-flu pneumonia and was started on 
ceftriaxone. 
Beta blocker was initiated. She remained in SR-ST throughout her 
ICU course.

The patient was evaluated by the physical therapy service for 
assistance with strength and mobility.  By the time of discharge 
on POD #24 the patient continues to be oxygen dependent (5L NC), 
was ambulating with assistance , the wound was healing and pain 
was controlled with oral analgesics.  The patient was discharged 
to ___ in ___ in good condition with 
appropriate follow up instructions.
Expected length of stay less than 30 days.

CT Chest ___:

FINDINGS: 
 
The imaged base of neck including the partially visualized 
thyroid is
unremarkable.  The thoracic aorta is mildly calcified, tortuous 
and normal in
caliber.  There is ___ mediastinal hematoma.  The main pulmonary 
artery appears
enlarged measuring 3.3 cm, correlate for pulmonary arterial 
hypertension.  ___
definite signs of lymphadenopathy within the chest.  The heart 
is mildly
enlarged without pericardial effusion.  Faint coronary artery 
calcifications
noted.  Trace pleural effusions are noted bilaterally.  There is 
associated
mild compressive lower lobe atelectasis.  Area of chronic 
appearing
atelectasis is noted in the right middle lobe.  There is 
significant
emphysema.  A new pulmonary nodule is noted within the right 
upper lobe best
seen on series 4, image 77, measuring 11 x 12 mm, new from prior 
exam and
highly concerning for malignancy.  ___ evidence of contusion, 
laceration, or
pneumothorax.
 
Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, ___ discrete 
abnormality is
seen.
 

Bones: Patient is undergone prior vertebroplasty at T8 which is 
unchanged from
prior.  There is new vertebroplasty at L2 and L3 partially 
visualized.  There
is increased collapse of the T9, T11, T12, and L1 vertebral 
bodies noted 1
compared with prior CT.  Mild compression involving the T6 
vertebral body is
unchanged.  A superior endplate compression deformity involving 
the T3
vertebral body may be acute.  Essentially nondisplaced fractures 
of the right
third, fourth, and fifth ribs noted along the anterolateral 
margin.
 
IMPRESSION:
 
 
1. Severe emphysema with new right upper lobe nodule measuring 
11 x 12 mm,
concerning for malignancy.
2. Right third fourth and fifth anterolateral rib fractures, 
nondisplaced.
3. Interval development of compression deformities and 
increasing collapse of
multiple thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies.  A T3 superior 
endplate
compression deformity appears acute.

CT CSpine ___
FINDINGS:  
  
The bones are demineralized.  ___ acute displaced fracture is 
seen.  There are 
mild C7 superior and inferior endplate deformities without 
evidence for acute 
fracture lines.  There is mild diffuse loss of height involving 
C4 and C5 
vertebral bodies which may be age related.  There is ___ evidence 
for 
prevertebral edema.  1 mm anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is noted, 
without 
evidence for disc space widening.  There is a mild dextroconvex 
curvature of 
the cervical spine, with dextroconvex thoracic curvature seen on 
prior chest 
radiographs from ___ disc protrusions, endplate 
osteophytes, and 
calcified ligamentum flavum indents the thecal sac at multiple 
levels with 
mild to moderate spinal canal narrowing.  There is multilevel 
neural foraminal 
narrowing by uncovertebral and facet osteophytes. 
  
There is minimal pleural thickening at the visualized lung 
apices.  There is a 
6 mm right thyroid nodule on image 301:51.  Carotid 
calcifications are noted.  
Partially visualized paranasal sinus disease is better assessed 
on the 
concurrent head CT, which is reported separately. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. ___ evidence for an acute displaced fracture allowing for loss 
of bone 
mineralization.  Mild deformities of C7 superior and inferior 
endplates 
without definite associated fracture lines. 
2. 1 mm anterolisthesis of C4 on C5 is almost certainly 
degenerative though 
there are ___ comparison exams to confirm chronicity. 
3. Multilevel degenerative disease. 
4. 6 mm right thyroid nodule. 

___ CT Head: FINDINGS:  
  
There is ___ evidence of acute hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or 
acute major 
vascular territorial infarction.  Extensive confluent 
periventricular, deep, 
and subcortical white matter hypodensities are nonspecific, but 
likely the 
sequela of chronic small vessel ischemic disease in this age 
group.  There is 
age related global parenchymal volume loss with prominent 
ventricles and 
sulci. 
  
There is ___ evidence of acute fracture. 
  
There is slightly heterogenous fluid moderately filling the left 
maxillary 
sinus, as well as mild mucosal thickening in the nondependent 
portion of the 
left maxillary sinus.  There are mild mucosal thickening and 
moderate mucous 
retention cysts in the right maxillary sinus.  There is 
mild-to-moderate 
mucosal thickening in bilateral ethmoid air cells, with 
aerosolized secretions 
and fluid in the left posterior and middle ethmoid air cells.  
There is 
mucosal thickening within the frontoethmoidal recesses, as well 
as moderate 
mucosal thickening in the right frontal sinus.  The frontal 
sinus septum and 
walls are sclerotic, suggesting sequela of chronic inflammation. 
 There is an 
osteoma with surrounding hyperostosis in the right posterior 
ethmoid. 
  
Mastoid air cells and middle ear cavities are well aerated.  
There is evidence 
of bilateral cataract surgery. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
  
  
1. ___ evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities or calvarial 
fracture. 
2. Paranasal sinus disease, including fluid and aerosolized 
secretions which 
may indicate acute sinusitis in an appropriate clinical setting. 
 Hyperostosis 
of the frontal sinus walls and in the right posterior ethmoid 
suggests sequela 
of chronic inflammation. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:

thrombosis (thought to be provoked by cancer hypercoaguable
state), recurrent shingles, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
glaucoma whom neurology has been consulted for assessment of
headache and left arm numbness. 

Patient reports that symptoms started ___ AM with gradual 
onset
feeling of mild to moderate achiness and soreness behind the 
left
ear.  There was some mild radiation to the left occipital region
and upper neck.  Patient could not wear glasses because the
pressure from the rounded portion was causing pain to the
affected area.  Patient could also not lay down because pressure
of placing head to pillow was causing pain to this area.  
Patient
denied that the pain she was experiencing was only in the 
context
of items touching this area, it was present without being 
touched
and was aggravated with being touched.    

Patient by ___ ___ had near resolution of symptoms and thought
she was OK.  Pertinently, they did not fully abate but were
minimal. 

Patient reports that ___ ___ that her same symptoms again
gradually came back. Patient's symptoms progressed over night. 
First there was additional involvement of the left frontal
temporal portion of the head and then involvement of the left
neck, shoulder, and arm.  Patient reports that there is a mild 
to
moderate headache of the left frontal temporal region and
describes it as an achiness, but cannot further describe it. 
Patient denies that there is a throbbing, pulsating, numbness,
burning, or tingling quality.  Patient then started to have

RECOMMENDATION(S):  T1 hypointensity along the inferior endplate 
of C3, new 
compared to ___, most likely represents discogenic 
bone marrow 
change. However, if clinically warranted, cervical spine MRI 
with and without 
contrast may be performed to exclude malignancy. 

CXR
No acute intrathoracic process. 

CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST
No evidence for acute intracranial abnormalities.  MRI would be 
more sensitive 
for further evaluation of neurologic symptoms, if clinically 
warranted. 

  

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient is a ___ year old right handed woman with PMH of
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (thought to be in remission), deep venous
thrombosis (thought to be provoked by cancer hypercoagulable
state), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and glaucoma who presented 
with headache and left arm numbness. 

She has a history of intermittent left shoulder pain usually 
provoked by activity. She developed fairly severe left cervical 
high paraspinal pain after she had been doing cleaning etc 
around the house, on ___ which worsened the following day to 
involve the left upper trapezius and the left arm down to the 
wrist. Left hand tingling and weakness have resolved. Troponins 
have been negative.

On examination she has tenderness over the left cervical
paraspinal muscles, the left upper trapezius, and over the
anterior left shoulder. She has trouble with forward flexion of 
the arm, which elicits pain at the shoulder. Rotator cuff 
impingement signs are
negative. 

CBC revealed normal white count. Basic metabolic panel is
normal. Vitamin B12 and folate are normal. Hemoglobin A1c was
normal. Cholesterol was 225, triglycerides 165, LDL 143. TSH
2.9, CRP 4.4, sed rate is pending. UA was normal. Lyme is
pending at time of discharge.

MRI of the brain revealed atrophy, white matter disease,
potential discogenic disease at C3, incompletely evaluated.

Her overall picture is consistent with musculoskeletal pain. 
Although a component of cervical radiculopathy may have been 
present, the quick resolution of
symptoms argues against it. The characteristic of the pain, with 
a deep soreness, worsened by shoulder movements and neck 
movements points to musculoskeletal etiology.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
--------------------
[] The patient is provided with a prescription for outpatient 
physical therapy. 
[] She should receive the Shingrix the killed zoster
vaccine given her history of shingles
[] Orthopedics clinic follow up for shoulder pain.
[] She should follow up with a cardiologist for her EKG findings 
of LBBB
[] She is ordered for an outpatient MRI C-spine. These results 
will need follow up.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms ___,

You presented to ___ because you were having 
headache and pain in your left shoulder as well as increased 
pain sensation down your left arm.

While in the hospital, most lab results were reassuring, 
although your cholesterol is quite high. Your symptoms are 
likely due to musculoskeletal strain. 

After you leave the hospital, we recommend that you follow up 
with your primary care doctor in clinic. You should also follow 
up with cardiology and consider a shingles vaccine. We also 
provided you with a prescription for outpatient physical 
therapy. You should also obtain an MRI of your spine (you will 
be contacted regarding an appointment).

We wish you the best,

Your ___ team

bleed secondary to angiodysplasia presenting with BRBPR 1 day 
after a colonoscopy with diverticulosis and s/p polypectomy.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:
# Lower GI bleeding: The patient had BRBPR and his hematocrit 
has been trended throughout the day, starting at 44.1 and 
trending to 40.7. He has a number of reasons to have lower GI 
bleeding given his history, but the time course after a recent 
colonoscopy seems likely to be secondary to the polypectomy 
itself. But given quick resolution, patient likely to just have 
post-procedural bleeding. Hct stable on discharge, 
hemodynamically stable. Will follow up with GI in one month. 
Continued ASA because risk of stroke/MI greater then increasing 
bleed. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:
# Hyperlipidemia: continue fenofibrate 

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- F/u with GI in one month

50세 남성이 심박 수위가 낮은 과거와 함께 PPM 후에 발생한 이환으로 전신 혈전증과 같은 증상 없이 현재의 소변에서 단일 에피소드의 출혈을 보였습니다. 그는 일요일 아침 식사 후 대장 내시경 검사를 받았으며, 그 다음 날에는 간헐적인 두통이나 실명 등의 징후를 나타내지 않았습니다. 복부 통증이나 직장출혈 시 통증도 없습니다. 이전에 동일한 경우는 약 10여 년 전에 있었고, 요즘까지 계속해서 지속되어 왔습니다. 또한 구토나 설사는 없었으며 잘 먹었습니다. 그의 이전 출혔 사건 이후, 그는 '안구종'이라고 알려졌으며, 캡슐 내시 경검사가 보여준 것처럼 작은 장관에서의 정확한 위치를 찾지는 못했습니다. ED에서는 초기 VS는 97·3 87·8 126·7 67·0 19·0%이었으며, 심초음파는 80번의 심실 패서 리듬을 보이며 SGARBOSSA 기준을 갖추지 않은 상태였다. 위장은 상담하여 계속되는 BRBPP로 인해 의학 입원이 필요하다고 권유하였으나 혈액형이 안정되고 환자의 동맥 압력이 안정되었다. 트로포닌은 0.03에서 <0.010으로 추락하고 있다.



과거 병력:
50년간의 좌측 측두골 신경계 질환이 있고, 무리 없는 뇌졸중은 없었다. 그리고 50년 동안의 왼쪽 측두체 신경염이 있었다. 그리고 지난 50년에 간염이었다. 그리고 마지막으로 50세 때의 우울증이 있었다.


사회 역할:
50대 여성이다.

 가족 역할 :
어머니는 자신의 나이에 대한 GI 출형인데다가 아버지 역시 자신의 낭치기에 사망하였다. 그리고 가족 중에서도 뇌동맥류가 없었다.

___: CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH CONTRAST
1. 6.0 x 5.4 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass along the left 
aspect of the L5 vertebral body invades into the paraspinal 
musculature and the left L5 neural foramen.  Enhancing soft 
tissue extends into the left posterior spinal canal and 
displaces the dural sac. MRI could be obtained to further 
evaluate for spinal cord involvement. 
2. Lucent lesion in the L4 vertebral body has enlarged since 
___. Other lucent and sclerotic lumbar spine lesions 
are similar to prior. 
3. Splenomegaly with two 6 mm hypoenhancing splenic lesions, 
which may 
represent benign entities or less likely metastatic disease. 
Attention to 
these lesions is recommended on followup imaging. 
4. Stable configuration of left hip replacement with increased 
left lower 
extremity edema. Heterogeneous hyperdensity surrounding the hip 
prosthesis has increased since ___, but soft tissue thickening 
and ectatic vasculature in this region are chronic. 

___: CT LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY
1. Extensive soft tissue thickening in the left inguinal region 
causing 
marked attenuation and irregularity of the traversing common 
femoral vein and to a lesser extent the common femoral artery. 
While no enhancing mass is identified in this region and the 
findings likely reflect chronic inflammatory changes and 
scarring, a metastatic focus cannot be excluded.
2. There is a 5 cm centrally necrotic metastatic mass arising 
from the left lateral aspect of the L5 vertebral body extending 
posteriorly to the 
paraspinal soft tissues causing complete obliteration of the 
L5-S1 neural 
foramen and partial obliteration of the inferior L4-L5 neural 
foramen.  
3. Multiple probable metastatic lesions in the soft tissues of 
the lower 
extremity: 2 cm oval lesion posterior to the proximal femur, 1.7 
cm lesion adjacent to the profunda femoral vessels, and two 7 mm 
lesions overlying the vastus lateralis muscle.  
4. Multiple metastatic bony lesions: Lucent right L4 vertebral 
body focus, sclerotic right L5 vertebral body focus, and 
scattered nonspecific left ischial tuberosity and iliac crest 
foci are present.   
5. Dense intra medullary lesion in the femoral shaft just distal 
to the last antibiotic bead could represent another bony 
metastasis.   
6. Status post Girdlestone procedure with a moderate joint 
effusion with 
peripheral enhancement. 

___: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST:
1. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodule or mass. Stable small 
nodules, as 
described above.  Follow up on routine oncologic imaging is 
recommended. 
2. Progression of osseous metastatic disease, with new or more 
conspicious lesions at the right scapula and T1. Additional foci 
of osseous metastatic disease are stable. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx melanoma metastatic to bone ___ biologics/ipilimumab 
now on vemurafenib, prostate ca ___ TURP, SCC ___ excision, hx 
left hip MSSA arthritis, PE on coumadin, L leg lymphedema with 
recurrent cellulitis presents with venous stasis and c/f 
recurrent metastatic melanoma and treatment failure.

# LLE LYMPHEDEMA: Likely from distant lymph node dissection for 
treatment of his melanoma. His wound care included steroid 
creams continued based on his home regimen. His pain control 
regimen included fentanyl patch with PRN morphine of which the 
patient required very little. He seemed somnolent and confused 
on admission so his fentanyl dose was reduced from 50 mcg to 
25mcg with resulting improvement in mental status and continued 
good pain control. The patient was interested in discharge home 
with ___ rather than to rehab, and after ___ evaluation he was 
cleared for home with ___.

# METASTATIC MELANOMA: Leg lesions likely melanoma in-situ per 
dermatology consult obtained on admission. The lesions noted 
were red papules which the patient noted to have been spreading 
over the past week and increasing in number. Dermatology had 
biopsied an identical lesion ___ and the result of that 
pathology was metastatic melanoma so it was thought to be of low 
utility to repeat a biopsy. CT left leg showed extensive soft 
tissue disease also with femoral osseous mets. A CT abdomen 
pelvis/CT chest revealed mutiple vertebral metastases the 
largest of which was at the L5 level. This is all very likely 
progression of disease despite venfurafenib. Per Dr. ___ 
are other options for the patient, so he will follow up with Dr. 
___ as an outpatient to consider other therapies for his 
metastatic melanoma as he seems to have failed venfurafenib.

# HX PE AND EXTENSIVE DVT OF LLE-likely d/t severe lymphedema. 
He was admitted on coumadin and his coumadin was continued at 
the same dose with therpauetic INR daily. Lovenox is proven to 
be more effective than coumadin in malignancy associated DVT, so 
the patient should be considered for lovenox therapy instead of 
coumadin.

# HX OF MRSA INFECTION OF HIS PROSTHETIC HIP-Home minocycline 
suppressive therapy was continued during the hospitalization.

Transitional Issues:
-Please consider lovenox in this patient as it has been shown to 
be superior to coumadin in thrombosis associated with malignancy 

-On admission, the patient was on 50mcg fentanyl patch and was 
feeling confused and drowsy, his dose was reduced to 25mcg with 
good pain control and no sedating side effects

환자의 주요 불편 사항은 왼쪽 다리 통증입니다.

수술이나 침습적 시술: 없다.

병력 개요는 다음과 같습니다. 멜라닌종 전이가 골에 미치는 것으로서 바이오로지컬/IPILIMUMAB를 현재 베무라페닙을 받고 있습니다. 프로스테이트 CA가 있으며 TURPP이고 SCC가 있다. 좌측 엉덩이 MSSA 관절염과 PE는 코마딘으로 치료받았다. 좌발의 림프부전 및 재발성 세포막 손상이 있어 좌측 발목 절단을 고려하고 있다.

병력이 있는 환자가 초기 진단된 것은 ____였다. 좌대뇨선 검사에서 좌대 뇌물신경계와 관련하여 수술한 결과 좌대 부정맥 혈액투석이 발생했다. 이전에는 최소 사이클라인을 사용했지만 일부 피부색소침착이 있었다. 약 한 달 전에 심각한 좌측 측면통증과 홍반과 함께 삼차례 입원해 왔으며, 이후 정맥류와 같은 증상을 보였습니다. 또한 그의 왼팔 근육에서는 유사한 종양이 있었던 것이 발견되었다. 최근 백혈구 감소증과 관련하여 병력을 가지고 있다.

체계 검사는 모든 다른 시스템에서 음성이 없는 상태이다. 체온, 기침, 밤샘 흡수, 두통, 눈 변화, 비강 내비, 폐렴, 복통, 위장관 문제, 구토, 설사, 변비, BRBP 등 모두 음성이 없었다. 과거 병력은 다음과 같다. 과두암이 있거나 암세포가 있는 경우도 있다.

과거 병력이 있다. 과다흉부 조직검사를 통해 확산되어 왔다. 또한 그곳에서 간질환이나 말초 신경계 질환이 있을 수도 있다. 또한 그는 최근 허벅지와 무릎 부위의 붓기를 느꼈다. 또한 그가 경험하는 통증은 다른 곳에서도 나타났다. 그리고 그는 최근LYMPEDEMA를 경험하였다. 또한 양성림프절을 제거하기 위해 수술을 하기도 했다. 또한 항균제를 사용할 때는 소변을 보고한다. 또한 이때는 인공심장치료를 받았었다. 또한 이는 그의 생존율을 높이는 데 도움이 되었다. 또한 이것은 그의 삶의 질 향상에도 도움을 줄 것이다. 또한 그것은 그의 생명을 연장시키는 데 도움 될 것이다. 하지만 그것은 아직 완전히 해결되지 않았다. 또한 앞으로 더 많은 연구가 필요하다. 또한 우리는 그를 위한 새로운 치료법을 찾으려고 노력하고 있다. 그러나 아직까지는 확실하지 않다. 또한 우리에게는 더 이상의 정보가 없어서 추후 추가적인 검사가 필요하다.

또한 그는 최근에 악화되었는데, 이는 그의 생활 방식 때문이었다. 또한 이러한 상황들은 그의 삶에 영향을 미쳤다. 또한 그러한 행동들이 그의 건강에 해로운 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 따라서 우리는 이러한 행동들을 중단해야 한다. 또한 이를 위해서는 더욱 강력한 방법이 필요하다라고 생각된다. 또한 그렇다면 우리는 더 나아갈 수 있을 것이다. 또는 우리는 더 큰 힘을 얻을 수 있을 것이라고 믿는다. 또한 이제부터 우리는 더 좋은 방법을 찾아야 할 것이다. 아니면 우리는 더 크게 실패할지도 모른다. 하지만 우리는 계속해서 싸워야만 한다. 또는 우리가 더 나쁠 수 밖에 없다. 또한 지금은 우리가 가장 잘 알고 있는 바대로 진행하겠다. 또한 여기서는 더 이상 설명할 필요가 없다. 마지막으로 우리는 더 이상 지속될 수 없다고 생각한다. 또는 더 이상 우리가 알지는 못했던 것을 깨달을 수 있다고 생각한다.

따라서 우리는 더 적극적으로 대처해야 할 것이다! 또한 우리는 더 많은 시간을 보내야 할 필요가 있다! 또한 우리가 원하는 만큼 더 많이 배우고 싶다! 또한 더 많은 사람들과 교감하며 살아가는 것도 중요하다! 또한 나는 더 많은 사람들이 나를 이해하고 지원해 준다는 사실에 감사드린다!"

exertional angina. She was having pain in the neck and shoulders 
after walking 2 flights of stairs at a time. She had no 
shortness of breath, diaphoresis, or palpitations during each 
event.  
  
She ruled out for MI. She underwent cardiac catheterization and 
was found to have an 80% proximal LAD lesion and a 40-50% distal 
stenosis of her OM. The LCx had 40-50% distal lesion. The RCA 
and LMCA were normal. LVEF was normal. RHC revealed normal 
pressures. For the intervention, the patient was transferred to 
___.  
  
During the intervention the LAD lesion was stented however a 
linear density was seen that was ultimately thought to be due to 
eccentric calcification and not dissection. 2 DES were placed in 
the LAD and 1 DES was placed in LCX for a 70% distal lesion. 
During the procedure she developed neck/throat pain and 
intermittently had a LBBB on her EKG. She was started on a NTG 
drip and the case was completed as planned.  
 
Of note the patient had recently stopped her lipitor (myalgias 
and myositis) and HCTZ. She states that she recently started to 
be evaluated by her PCP for anemia which so far has only shown 
hypothyroidism. She was recently prescribed thyroid replacement 
but has not yet started the prescription.  
  
On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke, 
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the 
time of surgery, myalgias, joint pains, cough, hemoptysis, black 
stools or red stools. He denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. 
She denies exertional buttock or calf pain other than when on 
lipitor. All of the other review of systems were negative.  
  
*** Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of current 
chest pain, dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, 
orthopnea, ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.

Brief Hospital Course:
In brief the patient is a ___ year old woman with history of 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia who was referred for elective PCI 
following developing progressive exertional angina.

#CAD: The patient is a ___ year old woman with history of HTN, 
hyperlipidemia, diet controlled DM2 presenting for PCI c/b 
intermittent LBBB and anginal equivalent.  
Patient initially presented to OSH with exertional angina found 
to have signficant 2 vessel disease that is now s/p PCI with 
stent placement. The patient is was symptom free immediately 
following angioplasty with intermittent LBBB on EKG. Transfered 
from OSH due to concern regarding LBBB and concern that LAD had 
dissected during stent placement.  Patient initially had some 
nausea, chest pressure and headache following arrival in CCU, 
but EKG was unchanged from pre-cath EKG (no LBBB) and symptoms 
resolved with anti-emetics and rest.  Post-cath check was 
unremarkable, and over the next ___ hours of admission the 
patient's cardiac enzymes trended up, peaking at CK 529 and 
Troponin of 0.58.  On ___ the patient had an echo that showed 
a LVEF of 50-55%.  Patient began to ambulate on ___ and 
worked with physical therapy on ___.  Patient was restarted 
on home aspirin and ACE-inhibitor and started on plavix and a 
beta-blocker.  

#Anemia:  Patient was noted to be anemic and was transfused 2 
units packed RBC's on night of admission and on morning 
laboratories found to have an elevated TSH with a suppressed 
free T4, suggesting hypothyroidism as the etiology of her 
anemia, as iron studies, folate and B12 were normal and stool 
guaiacs were negative.  Pt was started on levothyroxine.

Brief Hospital Course:
MEDICAL HOSPITAL COURSE:

___ yo M with no PMH who presents with abdominal pain, found to 
have lipase of 13K consistent with pancreatitis, GPC bacteremia 
now s/p ex-lap to improve oxygenation to be transferred to SICU 
___.

# Acute Pancreatitis: Presented with lipase ___ to OSH c/w 
pancreatitis. While patient has history of EToH intake, the 
episode of pancreatitis was most likely secondary to a traumatic 
episode to the upper abdomen. Reportedly had CBD stone on 
informal ultrasound at ___ no biliary dilation or stone 
identified here. ERCP attempted ___ but unable to visualize or 
cannulate papillae given significant gut edema.  Triglycerides 
was normal. Fulminant course was not c/w autoimmune 
pancreatitis.  Pancreatitis was complicated by firm and 
distended abdomen raising concner for compartment syndrome. 
Given difficulty ventilating (see below), he underwent bedside 
ex lap ___.  He was transferred to the surgical ICU for further 
care.

# Distributive Shock:
# GPC bacteremia:
Shock likely primarily distribute ___ pancreatitis and 
bacteremia. Blood cultures resulted as ... Required pressors in 
setting of intubation and positive pressure. He was aggressively 
bolused with IVF. Started on vanc/ meropenem (___) 

#Hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure: He became 
increasingly tachypneic throughout the day. At ERCP on HD1 he 
became hypoxemic with significant difficulty oxygenating and 
ventilating requiring paralysis and very high peak pressures. 
This was likely secondary to high abdominal compartment 
pressures leading to restrictive physiology, low lung volumes, 
worsening v/q mismatch, also possibly ARDS i/s/o pancreatitis. 
With paralysis his oxygenation only improved slightly, 
ultimately hastening surgical consult and ultimately leading to 
a bedside ex-lap to relieve high compartment pressures. 
# renal failure- Oligouric/anuric, most likely ATN. Patient 
underwent multiple treatments of hemodialysis. Prior to 
discharge, his kidney function improved and he started urinating 
on his own. His last HD was ___, and his HD access 
line was removed prior to discharge to rehab per the nephrology 
team. 

CHRONIC ISSUES: 

# History of alcohol abuse: denied issues w/etoh initially but 
then reported ___ night binge drinking.   Started on versed drip 
given risk of withdrawal. 

# Chronic inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy: Very 
marked. Has had nerve conduction studies but no formal 
diagnosis. Has family history of neuropathies (___ 
and ___'s). 

# Communication:  Family member name: ___
 ___ member relationship: Father
 ___ contact number: ___
# Code:  Full

Imaging:
Echo ___:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left 
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is 
normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal 
(LVEF 60-70%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are focal calcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve 
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not 
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve 
prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary 
artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no 
pericardial effusion.  
CTA Chest ___:
1. No pulmonary embolus. 
2. Left lower lobe peribronchial infiltration representing 
infection or 
inflammation. 
3. Mild atelectasis at the right base and a tiny right-sided 
pleural 
effusion. 
CXR ___:
Mild cardiomegaly persists. Perihilar haziness, vascular 
indistinctness, and small bilateral pleural effusions are 
consistent with mild congestive heart failure and are unchanged 
compared to the prior examination. No focal consolidations or 
pneumothorax. A feeding tube courses 
beyond the limits of this examination. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted for excision left tongue lesion with STSG 
on ___.  Please see Dr. ___ note for 
details.  A dobhoff tube was inserted intraoperatively.  She 
tolerated the procedure well, was transferred to the PACU and 
then to floor in stable condition.  Pain was well controlled 
with IV morphine, then oxycodone and standing tylenol.  She was 
placed on subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and 
clindamycin while her bolster was in place.  Continuous tube 
feeds were initiated on POD1.  A nutrition consult was obtained. 
 On POD1 she had asymptomatic sinus bradycardia and 
nonreproducible chest discomfort.  Given her past h/o of post op 
PE, we had a low threshold to workup the chest pain.  Cardiac 
enzymes were drawn, which initially showed an elevated troponin 
of 0.7 (her GFR was normal) with a normal CKMB.  An ECG showed 
no acute changes from baseline.  A CXR showed signs of mild CHF. 
 Medicine was consulted and recommended a CTA chest and TTE in 
addition to our initial workup.  The CTA chest was negative for 
PE and her TTE was normal except for mild hypertensive 
cardiomyopathy.  Her cardiac enzymes were subsequently negative. 
 It is unclear what caused the initial troponin bump.  On POD1 
she also developed a drug rash, which resolved on 
discontinuation of clindamycin.  She was switched to 
ancef/flagyl at that time.  On POD3 her platelet count dropped 
from 122 to 72, concerning for HIT.  However, a repeat CBC 
showed a platelet count of 123, suggesting that the initial 
alarming result was spurious.  HIT antibodies were not sent 
given her low 4T score (ie low likelihood of HIT).  On POD5 her 
bolster was taken down and she was started on clears.  The 
following day she was able to tolerate softs and her dobhoff was 
removed. She was discharged to home on POD7 in good condition.

(R foot ulcer), OSA, Afib (not on coumadin ___ GIB) who presents 
w/ chills, malaise, fever and n/v.  
.
Pt. was in USOH, until the day of evaluation at 3pm, when she 
developed a sensation of malaise, chills, sweats followed by 
nausea and vomiting while cooking dinner.  Due to fatigue, she 
decided to lay down and hand an episode of emesis (non bilious, 
whitish colored).  Her daughter noted that she looked 
diaphoretic and pale while laying in bed as well as c/o of 
""twingy"" chest dyscomfort. Temp at home was 101.8 at which time 
EMS was called. Pt. denies any other preceeding sx, and infact 
was seen by her cardiologist earlier and told that she was doing 
well.  She denies fevers, cough, worsening SOB/DOE, PND or 
orthopnea.  She did report intermittent substernal discomfort, 
similar to her prior admission (see below).  She notes some 
sacral pain at area of her prior cyst.  Also notes that her 
right foot ulcer has not been healing and reports having had an 
injection of ""stem cells"" into the ulcer by her podiatrist.  No 
dysuria, loose bms, arthralgias or myalgias.  Notes intermittent 
HA w/o photophobia.  Reports neck discomfort, unchanged from 
prior.  No sick contacts. 

Of note, pt. was admitted last ___ to ___ for CP, w/ 
lateral STd and flat CEs, s/p cath w/ LCX occlusion, s/p DESx2 
for instent-restenosis, right ischemic foot ulcer consistent w/ 
chronic osteomyelitis (RLE angiogram w/ poor perfusion but no 
distal targets and given poor BF surgical intervention was not 
felt feasible.  

While in EMS, pt. was given zofran and Nitro spray.  Initial VS 
in ___ were 102.5F 122 170/80 20 100% 12L.  Pt. was felt to be 
tachypneic w/ increased WOB and somewhat confused.  Labs were 
notable for WBC of 14K w/ left shifts and 4 bands, BNP 8K (prior 
62K), Trop of 0.16, Cr 3.7 and lactate of 1.8.  ECG showed STd 
I, V5-6, and in II, aVF along w/ STe ___ team d/w 
cardiology who felt this was demand ischemia in setting of 
increased demand.  She received Zofran/Reglan IV, Acetaminophen 
650mg, ASA 300PR and 750mg IV Levofloxacin as well as 1L NS.  
Although her HR decreased to 110s, SBP was in ___ and she was 
admitted to MICU for hypotension.  VS on transfer were ___ 
23 97% 4L.  
.  
On arrival to the MICU, pt. appeared somewhat somnolent, but 
easily arousable and appropriately responsive.  C/o some 
discomfort in her sacrum that is unchanged over the past month.  
Per daughter, her mother appears much improved in terms of color 
and alertness.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo W with DM, ESRD on HD, CAD s/p multiple PCIs w/ most 
recent DES x2 to LCX, CHF w/EF ___, COPD on 2L home O2, PVD 
(R foot ulcer), OSA, Afib (not on coumadin ___ GIB) who presents 
w/ chills, malaise, fever and hypotension, found to have a UTI 
but also NSTEMI s/p cardiac cath and POBA of OM1.
.
1. Hypotension: Likely multifactorial, but mostly cardiogenic 
shock and UTI, possible pneumonia. In setting of fever, n/v and 
malaise w/ leukocytosis and relative bandemia concerning for 
sepsis. The patient grew Klebsiella from her urine culture, but 
had negative blood cultures during her admission. She did not 
have physiology of cardiogenic shock, however, her EKG had 
demand changes and she had positive enzymes. The patient's 
hypotension resolved with continued supportive care. She will 
continue Levofloxacin 250mg Qday x 6 days for a total 14 day 
course.
.
2. NSTEMI:  The patient was initially free from chest pain, 
though her EKG was concerning for ischemia. Her cardiac enzymes 
suggested that she was indeed experiencing ischemia. Due to 
previous GI bleeds, heparin could not be started on patient. As 
patient became more stable, she had an episode of chest pain, 
which resulted in cardiac catheterization that showed severe 
native three vessel coronary artery disease, patent LIMA to LAD 
and SVG to OM2, and a new total occlusion of SVG to RCA. The 
patient received successful POBA of OM1 with a 2.0 x 12 mm 
balloon and successful RFA AngioSeal. She was discharged on 
Plavix, Aspirin, Metoprolol, Statin, and Nitroglycerin PRN.
.
3. Acute Systolic Heart Failure Exacerbation: Pulmonary 
congestion worsened during early MICU stay, but was able to 
remove fluid via ultrafiltration. The patient initially was 
unable to undergo a full dialysis schedule due to hypotension, 
but she then underwent 3 consecutive successful sessions with 
improvement in her weight and subjective dyspnea. She was able 
to be discharged on her home O2 requirement. She was discharged 
on low dose metoprolol, aspirin, and statin. She does not 
tolerate an ACEI. 

4.. RLE ulcer with dx of chronic osteo:  Arterial by description 
from prior podiatry notes.  Unable to examine as pt. refusing at 
this time.  PVD not amendable to intervention per pt. 
cardiologist. Podiatry evaluated patient, felt infection not 
likely and left wound care recommendations.
.
5. ESRD, due to DM/HTN: Continued hemodialysis and 
sevelamer/nephrocaps.
.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was not on anticoagulation 
secondary to history of GI bleeds. During ICU stay, her atrial 
fibrillation was difficult to control due to holding metoprolol 
due to hypotension. As she stabilized, the patient's home 
metoprolol was returned and she received amiodarone in loading 
dose and continued at 400mg Qday. By discharge, the patient had 
good rate control.
.
7. COPD: on home ___, currently at baseline. No wheezing on 
exam. Continued albuterol and ipratropium.
.
8. DM: Continued home NPH and SS.
.
9. Hypothyroidism: Continued home levothyroxine.
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- The patient met with palliative care while she was here and 
there was some discussion about goals of care and possible 
hospice. The patient will continue to have this discussion with 
her family
- The patient can have uptitration of many of her cardiac meds 
as needed, depending on her SBP. The patient can go up on her 
midodrine to TID as needed as well.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you had fever, chills, 
and fatigue at home. In the ___, you had low BP and signs of 
infection, so they stabilized you in the ICU before you were 
transfered to the cardiology service. While you were in the ICU, 
you had chest pain and positive cardiac enzymes and we found 
during a catheterization that you had a blockage of one of your 
coronary vessels, however, no intervention was undertaken. We 
continued to get fluid off with dialysis, which was initially 
limited due to hypotension. Your hypotension resolved, and we 
were able to get you on your heart failure medications and 
perform multiple dialysis to get the extra fluid off. We treated 
you for a UTI. Our podiatry colleagues evaluated your foot ulcer 
and would like to follow up with you as an outpatient. 

Weigh yourself every morning, call MD if weight goes up more 
than 3 lbs.

주민등록번호: ____________________

환자의 주장: 없음

질병의 원인과 경과는 다음과 같다:

혈액검사 결과: 혈압은 낮았고 체온도 높았다. 심전도 검사는 이상으로 나타났다. 심근경색증을 받았다. 당뇨병 환자가 있다. 심부전이 있었다. 부비동염이 있었으며, 발목 통증이 있었다.

심리 상태와 정신 상태는 정상이었다. 활동 수준은 중등도로 평가되었다. 식욕 증세가 없었다. 소화불량이 없었으나 위염이 있었다.



수술 및 침습적 절차: 좌측 심실 카테터 삽입, 중앙 라인 배치, 동맥선 배치 등이 있었다.


내과 병력: 복합적인 심장 질환이 있었다. 관상 동맥 재관류술 후에 심근 경색증이 발생했다. 간염이 있고, 고혈압이 있으며, 고지혈증이 있는 것으로 보였다. 또한, 만성 신부종이 있어 왔다. 심한 허혈로 인해 사망했었다. 심장 전문의에게서 치료를 받았다.

사회력: 어머니가 죽었고, 딸이 생겼다. 아버지가 폐암으로 사망했고, 누나가 뇌종양으로 사망했다. 손자는 대식으로 사망하고, 딸은 심각한 심장 문제를 가지고 있었다.

신체 검사결과: 일반적으로 비정상적인 상태였지만 쉽게 깨울 수 있었다. 두통이나 어지럼증은 없었다. 가슴 통증이나 호흡 곤란은 없었다.

임상 역사: 심장병력이 많아 심장전문에서 진단받았다. 다발성 골절이 있었고, 심장마비가 있었다. 심장이 약간 불안정하였다. 심박수가 빠르고, 혈중 칼슘 농도가 높은 것이 특징이다. 심계항진제 사용 시에는 심장 마비가 일어날 가능성이 있으므로 피해야 한다.

사회 역학: 가족 내 감염이 없다고 하였다. 가족 구성원의 대부분이 사망하였고, 현재는 혼자 살고 있다고 하였다.

시술 기록: 심낭염이 있을 수도 있다는 점에서 주의할 필요가 있다. 구강 세균감염이 일어나면 항생제 투여가 이루어졌다. 심미술이 진행되어야 하는 경우가 많았다. 그리고 심장 기능 장애가 있었다.

출산 이력: 심장이 좋지 않아서 심장 관련 질홀이 많이 있었다. 특히 심장 발작이 자주 발생하여 심장 전문가로부터 지속적인 관리를 받아왔다. 심장은 잘 작용하지 못하는데다가 심장 조직이 크게 변형된 것도 확인되었다. 심장을 보호하기 위해 여러 가지 방법을 시도하려고 했다. 그러나 심장 근육이 강하게 저항하며 심장 운동이 어려웠다. 심방세동이 계속해서 발생하여 많은 시간 동안 심장 분만이 필요한 상황이 되었다. 심호흡법을 통해 심장 회복력을 키우려 했지만 효과가 미약하였다. 따라서 더 큰 도움이 필요하다.

심장 전공의는 심장에 대한 이해를 바탕으로 심장 건강을 유지하려 노력한다. 심리가 안정되지 않은 상태에서 심장 과부하가 발생하면 심장 부상을 입을 위험이 있다. 따라래 심장 상태를 파악하고 적절히 관리해야 할 것이다. 심정도는 심장이 안정되도록 하고 심장 기능을 최대한 활용하도록 해야 한다. 심리 상태는 심각하지만 심장은 비교적 양호한 편이다. 하지만 심장 외에도 다른 부분에서도 심각했던 사례들이 있어서 더욱 주의가 요구된다. 심리는 심장뿐 아니라 전체 몸에 영향을 줄 수 있다. 그러므로 심장 뿐만 아니라 전체 몸을 고려하여 관리해야 한다."

patches and Flexeril prn, all with minimal relief. She has also
been going to Physical Therapy for the past couple weeks. She 
was
recently seen in the Pain Clinic where she was told to replace
Ibuprofen with Meloxicam 7.5mg BID and started on Gabapentin for
her right hip pain thought to be neuropathic. While none of 
these
medications offer significant relief, she has still been able to
perform ADLs, although has been on ""light duty"" at work. She saw
her PCP last week who ordered a MRI T-Spine, which was done this
morning and read as a severe T12 compression fracture with 
severe
cord compression. She was sent to the ED and Neurosurgery Spine
called to evaluate.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. ___ presented to ___ ED after complaints of chronic 
back pain acutely worsening. Patient was seeing a chiropractor 
for her back pain however underwent aggressive manipulation and 
continued to feel worsened pain for which she saw her PCP. 
Patient's PCP ordered and MRI of the spine revealing a severe 
T12 vertebral body fracture with extension into the pedicles and 
cord compression. Patient was immediately contacted and told to 
present to the ED. 

#T12 fracture
Patient was subsequently admitted to the neurosurgery service 
for further management. Patient underwent a CT of the T&L spine 
which revealed a severe T12 compression fracture with subsequent 
kyphosis and extension into the pedicle with retropulsion and 
cord compression. T12 left pedicle with lucency and concern for 
underlying lesion. Due to concern for underlying lytic lesion 
patient underwent ___ guided biopsy on ___. Patient tolerated 
the procedure well and was transferred back to the floor 
post-procedure. Patient was ordered for a TLSO brace to be 
delivered and fitted on ___. Patient also underwent MRI with 
and without contrast of the T&L spine which redemonstration 
""severe pathological compression deformity of the T12 
vertebral body with complete vertebral body height loss, 
kyphotic angulation 
and severe spinal canal stenosis with cord compression"". 
Patient's pain was managed with PRN analgesics. Pathology 
results pending at time of discharge and neurosurgery office 
will contact patient once results are finalized to determine 
surgical plan.

systolic function. Increased PCWP. No definite structural 
cardiac source of embolism identified.

___ CXR
Compared to prior chest radiographs since ___, most 
recently ___. 
Feeding tube, with the wire stylet in place now ends below the 
diaphragm in the mid stomach. 
Lungs lung volume but clear.  No pulmonary edema.  Moderate 
cardiomegaly 
increased.  No appreciable pleural effusion or indication of 
pneumothorax. 

___ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. New acute infarct in the right anterior cerebral artery 
distribution 
involving the superior parasagittal frontal lobe, right 
cingulate gyrus and areas of right superior parietal lobe near 
the vertex, there is no evidence of acute hemorrhagic 
transformation. 
2. Stable encephalomalacia in bilateral anterior frontal lobes, 
right greater than left. 

___ CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. New right anterior cerebral artery distribution infarction, 
appears 
subacute. 
2. Stable bifrontal encephalomalacia with a background of 
senescent volume 
loss. 

___ EEG
This is an abnormal video-EEG monitoring session because of a 
slower than normal background without clear wakefulness. No 
focal or 
epileptiform features were seen. 

___ ECG
Sinus rhythm. Prominent voltage in leads I and aVL for left 
ventricular 
hypertrophy. Compared to the previous tracing of ___ the 
anterolateral 
ischemic-appearing T wave abnormalities are less prominent. 
There is increased voltage recorded in leads I and aVL. Followup 
and clinical correlation are suggested.  

___ MR HEAD W/O CONTRAST
1. 2 punctate foci of low diffusion in the right frontal lobe, 
near the 
convexity, which may represent small acute infarcts versus 
artifact. 
2. Stable bifrontal encephalomalacia with a background of 
senescent volume 
loss. 

___ CTA HEAD W&W/O C & RECONS
1. Stable bifrontal encephalomalacia, likely sequelae of prior 
infarct.  No acute hemorrhage. 
2. Area of hypodensity in the medial left parietal lobe, which 
appears to have been present on the prior CT, but appears more 
prominent likely given 
differences in technique and secondary to sulcal prominence. 
3. Focal cut off of the mid right A2 segment of uncertain 
chronicity. 
4. Approximately 30% stenosis of the proximal right internal 
carotid artery by NASCET criteria. 
5. Extensive dental disease, recommend dental consultation. 

___ Video swallow 
SUMMARY:
Ms. ___ presents with a moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia,
characterized by oral phase deficits, reduced laryngeal valve
closure, and a swallow initiation delay. This resulted in
intermittent laryngeal penetration with nectar-thick liquids and
consistent laryngeal penetration with thin liquids, with thin
liquid material in the airway resulting in events of aspiration.
Recommend pt initiate diet of nectar-thick liquids and pureed
solids, pills crushed in applesauce. Standard aspiration
precautions apply. Pt will require assistance with meals during
her admission and upon return home. Prognosis for return to
baseline swallow function guarded at this time given 
neurological
changes and pending improvement to laryngeal/pharyngeal 
sensation
and airway protection. ___ and MD team re: tube feed
weaning and need for continued enteral nutrition. Provided pt
with handout on obtaining thickening packets when she returns
home. Recommend SLP f/u for continued dxtx on an outpatient 
basis
or with home visiting services. We will continue to follow to
assess diet tolerance. Please page for questions/concerns in the
interim.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Initiate PO diet of nectar-thick liquids and pureed solids
2. Pills: crushed in applesauce
3. TID oral care
4. Standard aspiration precautions, including:
- 1:1 assist
- Small sips/bites
5. Recommend SLP f/u upon discharge on an outpatient basis or
through home services for continued dxtx
6. We will continue to follow to assess diet tolerance. Please

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo ___-speaking F with history 
of hypertension, diabetes, HLD, old right pontine/left basal 
lacunes presents with an episode of confusion and reduced speech 
found to have an acute right ACA infarct. 

Patient was admitted for MRI which was initially negative. On 
___ the patient had an episode of fluctuating L-sided 
weakness/alertness. EEG was negative. Repeat MRI showed an acute 
infarct in the right anterior cerebral artery distribution 
involving the superior parasagittal frontal lobe, right 
cingulate gyrus and areas of right superior parietal lobe near 
the vertex, with no evidence of acute hemorrhagic 
transformation. She was seen and evaluated by Speech and Swallow 
in the context of high risk of aspiration after her stroke, as 
well as fluctuating mental status and abulia. She failed swallow 
evaluation and was made NPO to prevent aspiration. A dobhoff was 
placed and she was started on tubefeeds per nutrition 
recommendation. TTE was done for stroke work-up which was 
negative for intracardiac thrombus. Severe aortic stenosis was 
incidentally found. Cardiology was consulted who recommended 
outpatient management. She was seen and evaluated by ___ and OT, 
who recommended rehab for further care and recuperation after 
discharge. However, as she is undocumented and does not have 
insurance benefits for rehab, she will have to be discharged 
home and cared for by her family. She lives with her daughter 
and granddaughter. The most notable barrier to discharge was her 
NPO status and aspiration risk. Family meeting on ___ revealed 
that daughter would like more time to discuss PEG with her 
brother and out of country family. On ___, patient had a video 
swallow and patient was started on nectar thickened liquids and 
pureed diet, which she is tolerating well. Due to lack of 
insurance, patient discharged home with 24 hour care with 
extensive education from case management regarding resources, 
including Hoyer lift, nursing education regarding crushed 
medication administration, nutrition education regarding pureed 
and nectar thick diet and ___ education regarding transfers, 
turns in bed, etc.

Transitional issues:
-cardiology follow-up for severe aortic stenosis
-continue swallow follow-up, advance diet as tolerated

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,  
 
You were hospitalized due to symptoms of left sided weakness, 
decreased speech resulting from an ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE, a 
condition where a blood vessel providing oxygen and nutrients to 
the brain is blocked by a clot. The brain is the part of your 
body that controls and directs all the other parts of your body, 
so damage to the brain from being deprived of its blood supply 
can result in a variety of symptoms.  
 
Stroke can have many different causes, so we assessed you for 
medical conditions that might raise your risk of having stroke. 
In order to prevent future strokes, we plan to modify those risk 
factors. Your risk factors are:  
- Diabetes
- high cholesterol

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- please start taking aspirin and Plavix (clopidogrel) every day
- started atorvastatin 80mg daily
- started amantadine daily to increase alertness after your 
stroke

Please take your other medications as prescribed.  
 
Please followup with Neurology and your primary care physician.

History of Present Illness:
This is a ___ y/o M with a history of obesity, HTN, NIDDM, 
Hypercholesterolemia, DVT s/p IVC filter placement and PE on 
coumadin, who presents with worsening SOB over the past 3 weeks. 
He was seen by his PCP ___ on ___ for SOB, and per 
patient, diagnosed with ""bronchitis."" He was given Advair, which 
did not relieve his symptoms. Since then he has become gradually 
more short of breath, especially with exertion, such that he has 
to rest after walking only a few feet. At rest, he denies SOB. 
He sleeps on 2 pillows at baseline but notes that he is now 
completely unable to lie flat. He also notes a dry cough that 
developed a few days ago and a sensation that there is 
""something"" in his chest that he just can't cough up. He denies 
fevers, chest pain, left arm or jaw pain, sweating, leg pain or 
swelling, and weight gain. (Baseline weight is 338lbs, was 
335lbs at ___'s office today). He also denies recent travel, 
sick contacts, smoking, and h/o asthma. He notes that this 
dyspnea is somewhat similar but less severe than when he had a 
PE in ___ at that time he was completely unable to walk. He 
re-presented to ___'s office today and was found to be 
tachypneic w/ RR28, O2Sat 945, HR 108, BP 130/100. Of note, he 
decreased his coumadin dose last week as his INR was 3.7 on 
___. 

In the ED, vitals were T 97.6, P ___, BP 122-134/70-93, RR 
___, O2Sat 98%RA. He was given levofloxacin 750mg IV x1 and 
nebs x1. He had a CXR and chest CT to rule out PE, but was 
unable to complete the scan because he could not lie flat. Due 
to concern for PE, he was bolused with heparin and then started 
on heparin gtt. 

On exam, he again denies CP and notes that dyspnea is improved 
with rest, nebs, and supplemental 02.

Brief Hospital Course:
#Dyspnea - Differential diagnosis included PNA, PE, MI and CHF 
(likely systolic), with highest suspicion for volume overload in 
setting of CHF given exam, history, imaging, and elevated BNP. 
He does have a significant DVT/PE history, but because he has an 
IVC filter and INR was supra-therapeutic when his symptoms 
began, suspicion for PE was low. Admission Chest CT showed 
bilateral effusions and bilateral LL opacities, which may 
represent infection, edema, or atelectasis. He was unable to 
complete the IV contrast portion of the CT scan and thus PE 
could not fully be ruled out. He was started on heparin drip and 
kept on this overnight until INR >2.0. Once INR became 
therapeutic, heparin gtt was d/c'd and patient was transitioned 
to home coumadin dose PO. Admission labs showed elevated CKMB 
and mildly elevated troponin. He was given NTG, morphine, 
metoprolol x1, though suspicion for ACS was low. He was 
maintained on ASA 325mg, simvastatin 20mg, and home ___. Cardiac 
enzymes were cycled and trended down. EKG was not consistent 
with acute MI. Given than he had been afebrile and with minimal 
cough, he did not receive antibiotics. Urine legionella Ag was 
negative. Attempted to obtain sputum cultures but patient could 
not generate sputum to send. The patient was given lasix 20mg IV 
x2 and met goal UOP of ___ negative, with improvement in 
symptomatic dyspnea and oxygen requirement. Patient was also 
given albuterol and ipratropium nebs prn. Echo was ordered but 
not completed before discharge to floor.  On floor cont'd 
diuresis with goal of ___ L/day.  TTE showed global 
dysfunction, dilated CM.  Cardiology following t/o 
hospitalization. W/u for global CM performed with no 
idenitifiable cause obtained.  Underwent cardiac cath which 
showed minimal disease.  Cont'd on ___, held CCB, startedon 
coreg, lasix and aldactone and cont'd on as outpt.  Will 
follow-up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ the week for CM. 
   
.
#.NIDDM: Home hypoglycemic agents were held and patient was 
maintained on ISS.  Restarted on home meds on d/c. 
.
#.HTN: Patient given home ___ but holding home CCB. Started on 
Coreg with success in HTN control.
.
#.Gout: Asymptomatic. Allopurinol continued.
.
# PE PPx: On coumadin on admission.  INR subtherapeutic on 
arrival.  Held for procedure on heparin gtt, restarted on 
coumadin afterwards bridging with heparin gtt until therapuetic 
INR acheieved.

Discharge Disposition:
Home
 
Discharge Diagnosis:
Shortness of breath, secondary to systolic Congestive Heart 
Failure
 
Discharge Condition:
Improved, INR therapeutic, hemodynamically stable

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were evaluated in the hospital for your shortness of breath 
and recent changes in your heart function. You were found to 
have a dilated heart that has reduced efficiency in its ability 
to pump blood as well as it did several months ago.  It remains 
unclear why this occurred, but cardiology was able to perform a 
cardiac catheterization that showed you only a small amount of 
disease in the arteries that supply blood to your heart.

Because we stopped your coumadin for this procedure, we had to 
keep you in the hospital to restart your coumadin and wait for 
the blood thinning effects of the coumadin to work before your 
discharge.
Please continue your home medications with the following 
changes:
Start: Coreg, Albuterol, Ipratropium, Valsartan, Lasix, 
Aldactone
Stop: Amlodopine.

Please call your doctor or return to the ER with:
* Worsening of your shortness of breath
* Chest pain or pressure
* Fevers, chills, nausea or vomiting
* With any new concerns

a
generalized convulsion following sleep deprivation on a long
flight.  That seizure lasted three to four minutes.  MRI and EEG
were both normal at that time.  She had a second event in ___,
which was unwitnessed but was heard by her husband as having 
some
loud bumps in the bathroom and she was quizzed when he found her
shortly thereafter.  She was initially started at that time on
Lamictal but had recently had that discontinued.  More recently,
for the last couple of weeks, she has had episodes that she says
occur almost every night that are characterized by a sense of
nausea or annoying in her stomach followed by a rising 
sensations
through her abdomen and chest followed by a sense of anxiety or
nervousness.  She has urinary incontinence with it every time. 
This sense of anxiety gradually progresses over 10 to 15 
minutes,
at which time it peaks and begins to subside over the hour.

In general, there are no convulsive movements with these
episodes, although apparently two nights ago, she did have some
whole body shaking without loss of consciousness.  She has
otherwise felt well recently with no fevers or chills, diarrhea,
constipation, nausea, vomiting, or chest pain.  She does not 
have
any diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, focal numbness, focal

EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. 
Routine
sampling showed a 12 Hz posterior dominant rhythm with 
occasional
periods of bifrontal slowing and single episode of two sharp 
waves of
phase inversion at C4.
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured three pushbutton activations 
with
no epileptiform features associated. Routine sampling showed an 
11 Hz
well-organized posterior dominant rhythm during wakefulness. 
There were
no focal areas of prominent slowing and there were no 
epileptiform
features on routine sampling.
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured seven pushbutton activations 
over
four episodes. The second episode, which occurred at 19:57:44, 
showed
six to eight seconds of diffuse spike and slow wave discharges.
Clinically, the seizure was characterized by clearing the 
throat,
smiling slightly, and leaning head forward. There were no 
convulsions
or eye changes with this. A second seizure was detected by the 
seizure
detection program at 11:35:33 and consisted of 22 seconds of 
generalized
spike and slow wave discharges with a right fronto-temporal
predominance. Clinically, this event was similar to the other 
described
seizure with clearing of the throat, peering slightly downwards 
and
smiling. Routine sampling showed an 11 Hz somewhat poorly 
organized
background with occasional spikes at F4.
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no pushbutton activations. 
Routine
sampling showed an 11.5 Hz background. Spike detection programs 
showed
occasional right fronto-central spikes or polyspikes. There were 
no
seizures captured on this recording.
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: There were a number of pushbutton events but they 
were all
for minor symptoms and were not associated with a clear change 
on EEG.
Routine and automated sampled EEG appeared to be within normal 
limits.
EEG (___):
IMPRESSION: This telemetry captured four pushbutton activations 
which
occurred for unclear circumstances. There were no electrographic

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a lovely ___ year-old right-handed woman with a past 
medical history including two generalized convulsions and recent 
episodes of nausea associated with a rising sensation in the 
abdomen and chest, nervousness, and urinary incontinence, who 
presented ___ for long-term monitoring and evaluation of 
these events.  The patient was admitted to the Epilepsy Service 
and Video EEG recording was performed over six days.

Investigative studies showed no evidence of contributory toxic, 
metabolic, or infectious processes.

At the time of admission, clonazepam was discontinued with the 
goal of precipitating and characterizing a typical episode.  
While telemetry did show occasional bifrontal slowing and two 
isolated sharp waves of phase reversal, there were no 
electrographic seizures in the first three days.  On ___, the 
patient experienced two brief (<30 seconds) clinical events 
consisting of a head tilt forward with smiling and throat 
clearing.  The EEG correlate demonstrated generalized spike and 
slow wave discharges with a right fronto-temporal predominance.  
There were no subsequent electrographic seizures in the course 
of the visit.

Sleep deprivation was encouraged in advance of an ictal SPECT 
scan on ___.  The study demonstrated increased tracer uptake in 
the superior deep right temporal lobe.  Collectively, the data 
were thought to support seizure as an explanation for the 
patient's presenting symptoms.  Accordingly, treatment with 
Brand Name ___ was initiated.  Clonazepam was 
re-started with a plan to taper the medication with concomitant 
increases in Lamictal. 

As the patient fell shortly before discharge, a non-contrast 
head CT was performed to ensure no injury.  There was no 
evidence of hemorrhage or other concerning changes.  At the time 
of discharge the patient was asymptomatic.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ for long-term telemetry monitoring to 
better characterize your seizures and optimize your 
anti-epileptic drug regimen.  While the specific symptom complex 
(GI distress, sweating, and urinary urgency+/- incontinence) 
that prompted your visit did not correspond with epileptiform 
discharges on video EEG monitoring, it is thought represent 
seizure activity.  Of note, telemetry did show seizure activity 
that corresponded with clinical episodes in which you lifted 
your right arm, coughed, and appeared distracted for about ten 
seconds.  The ictal spect scan was also helpful in identifying 
the right temproal lobe as a potential seizure focus.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a ___ w/ hx of NSAID induced gastric ulcers and 
eosinophilic esophagitis found 3months ago on EGD, p/w some 
weakness and dark tarry stools.  

#Upper GI bleed: Patient has history of ulcers from NSAID use 
confirmed on EGD previously, possible recent trigger being 
alcohol use vs inadequate PPI dosing. He was now having 
abdominal pain and dark stools, since in ED, no recurrent 
bleeding, HD stable and with guaiac positive brown stools. He 
was placed on IV Pantoprazole BID, and monitored for bleeding 
and hemodynamic instability. He remained minimally symptomatic 
with epigastric pain, with stable blood pressures and heart 
rate. Patient was initially NPO, with diet advanced with 
stability. His serum was sent for H.pylori testing, which was 
pending on discharge. He was discharged to home on omeprazole 
40mg BID and with follow-up in place with Dr. ___ 
endoscopy on ___.

#Eosinophilic Esophagitis: confirmed on recent biopsy, likely 
contributing to persisting GERD symptoms and abdominal pain. 
Patient was discharged on PPI BID. Outpatient providers can 
track if PPI responsive, can consider glucocorticoids on 
outpatient followup. He may also warrant outpatient allergy 
evaluation.

Discharge Instructions:
Instructions: Dear Ms. ___, 

It was a pleasure to be a part of your care team at ___ 
___.

====================================
Why did you come to the hospital? 
====================================

-You had persistent vomiting and diarrhea.

====================================
What happened at the hospital? 
====================================

-You were given IV fluids because the vomiting and diarrhea had 
dehydrated you. 
-You underwent evaluation by the gastroenterology specialty 
team. You had a flexible sigmoidoscopy and the lining of the gut 
looked normal. This, combined with the fact that your diarrhea 
is non-inflammatory appearing (no blood in the stool), makes a 
flare of your ulcerative colitis highly unlikely to be the cause 
of your acute symptoms. Please note, the gastroenterologist took 
a biopsy of the colon lining for routine check in our lab. Once 
the results are available, the gastroenterologist will notify 
you of the result.
-Most likely your symptoms are due to a viral gastroenteritis. 
The treatment is supportive care, to drink plenty of fluids and 
eat enough to replace any losses by diarrhea, and get plenty of 
rest. It may still take several more days for all the symptoms 
to resolve entirely. It is safe for you to take Loperamide to 
slow down the diarrhea.
-We still checked your stool sample for specific bacterial 
causes that would require antibiotic treatment (such as 
shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, specific E coli strains, 
etc). It can take a couple more days to result in the lab. If 
the results are abnormal we will call you. 

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your stay! 

Sincerely, 

Your ___ team

CXR:
As best can be determined, compared to the prior torso CT, again 

relatively stable is the extensive right apical pleural 
thickening extending along the lateral margin of the right upper 
chest. The volume loss is qualitatively similar. There is a 
suture line projecting over the dome of the left hemidiaphragm. 
The left and right lungs respectively are grossly clear. The 
mediastinum is unremarkable. There is rightward deviation of the 
trachea at the level of the aortic arch. The cardiac silhouette 
is within normal limits for size. There is no effusion or 
pneumothorax. The visualized osseous structures are 
unremarkable.
IMPRESSION: As best can be determined, the volume loss of the 
right lung is relatively stable. There is no definite 
superimposed acute pulmonary process. 

CT chest:
1. Essentially unchanged CT of the chest demonstrating right 
apical fibrosis and traction bronchiectasis and stable 
appearance of pulmonary nodular opacities. 
2. A hyperdense cyst in the left kidney is incompletely 
characterized; if clinically indicated, consider abdominal CT or 
ultrasound for further 
characterization.

CT Head:
1. Intracranially, there are no findings to suggest an 
underlying mass lesion. If suspicion remains high, consider 
contrast-enhanced MRI for the 
most sensitive evaluation.  
2. The osseous lesion in the sphenoid bone as detailed above is 
nonaggressive in nature and highly atypical for lymphoma. It is 
likely a bone island or other benign entity. 

V/Q Scan:
Low likelihood ratio for recent pulmonary embolism.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo M with hyperlipidemia and distant hx of hodgkins presents 
with chest pain, fever, and leukocytosis.  
.  
# Chest pain: Cardiac causes were unlikely in the setting of 
minimal risk factors, poor response to NTG, negative CE and 
unchanged EKG. There were very mild EKG abnormalities showing PR 
depression (minimal) in lateral and limb leads originally 
concerning of pericarditis in the setting of viral infection 2 
weeks earlier and with the history of chest radiation. However, 
patient received morphine in the ER and chest pain fully 
resolved, which was thought to be to rapid to be compatible with 
pericarditis and in an asymptomatic patient would not 
necessarily require treatment. CT scan ruled out pneumonia and 
V/Q scan was low-probability for PE. Patient was discharged 
asymptomatic with PCP follow up after being given alarm signs 
and symptoms.
.
# Fever/leukocytosis: Originally with nausea and vomit 
associated with chest pain, but upon admission to the medical 
floor he was asymptomatic. Chest CT was negative for source of 
infection as well as a UA. Patient had negative blood cultures 
upon discharge, that will need follow up of final report. CT 
scan of the abdomen at ___ did not find any abdominal source 
of infection. LFTs were normal and patient did not have diarrhea 
or skin manifestations of GVHD. Differential was normal and pt 
was asymptomatic making recurrence of ca unlikely. He was 
discharge with close follow up with his PCP and CBC scheduled 
for next week. Patient was given printed order for laboratories 
and was asked to have them done at ___.
.
# SBO: Final read of abdominal CT scan at ___ reported 
partial SBO. However, patient was asymptomatic moving bowels, 
passing gas and tolerating diet. He was given warning signs and 
symptoms and was asked to follow with his PCP. 
.  
# Hyperlipidemia: Con't simvastatin  
.  
# CKD: Stable with creatinine of 1.9 (baseline) with eGFR of 40 
ml/min upon discharge. Medications were renaly dosed during 
hospitalization. 
.  
# FEN: IVF, Cardiac diet  
.  
# Access: PIV

Discharge Condition:
Stable, breathing comfortably in room air, pain free.

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were seen at ___ for chest pain/pressure. Your physical 
exam was normal, your EKG had minor changes not concerning for 
heart attack and your cardiac enzymes were negative. You had a 
CT scan of your chest that was negative for infection and a scan 
that puts you in the low probability group for a blood clot in 
your lungs. Your white blood cells were high during the 
hospitalization, so we looked for other infections including 
your blood and urine, but we did not find any source. You were 
asymptomatic and pain free during the hospitalization.
.
You had a rapid heart rhytm called supra ventricular tachycardia 
that resolved spontaneously. You did not have further episodes, 
and there is a chance that it was due to a precipitant 
associated with your pain and your increased white blood cells. 
However, it needs follow up with your PCP.
.
Your medications were left unchanged.
.
You will need to check your temperature on daily basis for the 
next 2 weeks.
.
If chest pain recurs, you have shortness of breath, cough, 
palpitations, fever >100.4, abdominal pain, or anything else 
that concerns you please come back to the ER.

Brief Hospital Courses :
Hyperlipidemic male with distant hx Hodgin’s presenting w/chest pain, febrile neutrophilic reaction. 

# Chest Pain: Cardiogenic causes were deemed unlikely by virtue of minimal risk factor profile, lack of response to nitroglycerin, absence of electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia, and failure to show significant ST segment depression despite presence of diffuse interstitial edema. This was felt to represent a false positive stress test secondary to respiratory tract infection rather than true myocardial infarction. Subsequent V/Q scans showed low probability for pulmonary thromboemboli. 

## Fever/Leukocystosis: Initially accompanied by nausea/vomiting related to chest pain but became asymptomatic while hospitalized. CXR revealed no abnormality except for slight mediastinal widening. Abdomen CT also failed to reveal any intra-abdominal cause of infection. Urinary sediment examination was unrevealing. Blood culture"

Imaging:

CXR (post pacemaker):

IMPRESSION: 
  
1. Left-sided pacemaker with leads in adequate position.  
  
2. Increased small left pleural effusion. 
  
3. Rightward deviation of the trachea may be suggestive of a 
thyroid mass. 

Echo ___:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is 
moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or 
color Doppler. The estimated right atrial pressure is ___ mmHg. 
There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal 
cavity size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Doppler 
parameters are most consistent with Grade II (moderate) left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and E/e' ratio is consistent 
with elevated filling pressure. Right ventricular chamber size 
and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) 
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no 
aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. An eccentric, anteriorly- 
directed jet of Mild to moderate (___) mitral regurgitation is 
seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is 
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
normal biventricular function. Biatrial enlargement. Mild to 
moderate, eccentric mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid 
regurgitation are seen. Moderate pulmonary artery systolic 
hypertension.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ female with a hx of HTN, HLD, and bradycardia who was 
transferred from OSH with bradycardia in ___ with chest pain

#Bradycardia: Most likely secondary to sick sinus syndome with 
resulting junctional rhythm. A dual chamber DDD pacemaker was 
place this admission. Procedure was well tolerated and 
interrogation of pacemaker on ___ was normal. Intrinsic rate set 
at 60bpm. She will follow up with Dr. ___ further 
management.

#Chest pain: Most likely related to bradycardia resulting in 
poor coronary perfusion. Trop was negative and  there were no 
concerning st changes on EKG.  Chest pain resolved with 
increased heart rate following pacemaker placement.  While she 
most likely has coronary artery disease, she has elevated 
medical management with aspirin 325 and statin. Metoprolol was 
added this admission following pacemaker placement. An echo was 
notable for a preserved EF of 55% with mild to moderate MR.

#Afib: Patient was not in atrial fibrillation this admission. 
She was continued on previously prescribed amiodarone and 
metoprolol was added following pacemaker placement. She is not 
on anticoagualtion due to hx of upper GI bleed.

#Hypertension: Patients blood pressure was elevated this 
admission in the systolic 160-170 range. Per patient, she only 
takes hydralazine once daily. She was transitioned to TID dosing 
and metoprolol was added as above.

#Facial tingling and droop: Patient developed facial tingling in 
setting of bradycardia which resolved with normal heart rate. A 
head CT was normal prior to transfer. She has a history of 
stroke with resulting right sided weakness at baseline which was 
unchanged. She was continued on aspirin daily.

Brief Hospital Course:
SUMMARY
========
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with ___ chromosome 
negative B-cell ALL (consolidation cycle 3, day 36 of protocol 
___, recurrent paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, 
treated C. difficile colitis, and PCOS who presented from clinic 
with neutropenic fever and transient urticaria. The night prior 
to admission, she had a temperature of 101.5, hives on the back 
and right cheek, and night sweats. Fever resolved in the 
morning, but returned in the afternoon to 101.2, prompting her 
to come in. Workup for viral and bacterial sources was negative, 
though parvo B19 and strep A culture pending on discharge. She 
received meropenem for 2 days, and after remaining afebrile with 
no clear source of infection, was transitioned to levofloxacin. 
As her ANC was > 1000, Neupogen was discontinued. The next 2 
days, her counts dropped, and she became relatively neutropenic, 
though remained afebrile and well without signs of infection. 
Patient preferred to leave the hospital and follow-up in 
transfusion clinic the next day for blood counts and possible 
blood products.

ACUTE ISSUES ADDRESSED
======================
# Neutropenic fever
Presented with fever, rosy cheeks, urticaria on back, legs on
presentation, which resolved after meropenem and Benadryl. She 
reported a sore spot deep in her throat with swallowing, though 
no other localizing symptoms. Blood and urine cultures were 
negative, chest xray unremarkable, respiratory viral screen, PCR 
were negative. Parvo B19 and strep A culture pending on 
discharge. She was treated with meropenem for two days and 
transitioned to levofloxacin as she remained afebrile, and 
throat symptoms resolved. Ultimately it was felt her fever was 
likely triggered by either gut translocation or transient viral 
infection not picked up by the limited panel available, and 
self-resolved. 

# ___ chromosome negative B-cell ALL
# Cytopenias
Ph-, t(1;19) and del(13q), CD20 neg, with CNS2 involvement
(subsequently cleared). Treated on protocol ___, MRD negative
following induction x2, consolidation x2, presented in cycle 3, 
day 36. She had received 6-mercaptopurine in accordance with 
study schematic which was in disagreement with the most updated 
study protocol. As such, her cytopenias were expected. Her 
chemotherapy regimen was held in the setting of fever and workup 
for infection. She had received Neupogen prior to and on the 
first day of admission, this was stopped on the second day as 
her neutrophil counts were over 1000. The following 2 days, all 
lines decreased. It was decided on discharge that she should 
resume Neupogen, and follow-up the next day for cell counts, 
possible transfusion, and neupogen. She was continued on 
prophylactic acyclovir and Bactrim SS this admission.

# Penicillin allergy
# Fluoroquinolone ?toxicity
Patient described taking amoxicillin and developing face and 
body hives, facial erythema and swelling but no oral or 
respiratory symptoms ___ years ago. No subsequent exposure. She 
had never had cephalosporins. She also reported side effects 
from fluoroquinolones, including joint and body aches. This 
fever occurred through Bactrim SS. So choice of 
deescalting/prophylactic antibiotics while neutropenic was 
somewhat challenging. This is her first episode of neutropenic 
fever, and it would be of great benefit to her if question fo 
cephalosporin cross-reactivity resolved prior to any future 
fevers.

CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS:
========================
# Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia
Previously diagnosed and worked up by cardiology; rate and 
rhythm control had been attempted, though caused bradycardia, so 
were avoided this admission. Patient initially placed on 
telemetry, which was unremarkable, so was discontinued. Patient 
was asymptomatic of this this admission.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] ___ F/u CBC w diff tomorrow in clinic, transfuse to hgb>7, 
plt>10
[] ___ give neupogen
[] Patient should undergo outpatient penicillin testing

 임상 역사 :
피해 환자는 주치의에게 2주 전에 머리가 아프고 발열, 기침, 무더운 날씨로 인해 통증이 생겼다고 한다. 그는 또한 식욕 부전과 함께 얼굴과 손목의 홍반과 가려움증을 보였다. 그의 혈압은 높았다. 그는 항생제를 먹었다. 그리고 다음날 오후에 발열이 사라졌다. 그는 또 다른 증상을 보였지만, 이는 그가 바이러스의 영향을 받았거나 소화관 이동 때문이라고 생각한다.

 추가적인 정보 :
그녀는 이전에 항생물질을 사용했으며, 현재는 약물을 복용 중이다. 그녀는 또한 면역력을 강화하기 위해 항산화제를 섭취하고 있다. 그녀는 아직도 건강하다. 그녀는 계속해서 자신의 약을 복용해야 하며, 다음날 오면 된다. 그녀는 다음날에도 같은 증상을 보여줄 것이라 예측된다. 그녀는 지금까지 아무런 문제 없이 잘 지냈다."

___, atrial fibrillation status-post cardioversion in ___, 
on warfarin with subtherapeutic INR, bradycardia felt to be due 
to amiodarone which was stopped and deranged LFTs which were 
improving by last discharge. He presented with a gout flare and 
as a result he was unable to attend dialysis. He was continued 
on allopurinol at increased dose of 100mg daily and treated for 
his acute gout flare with a five day course of prednisone. He 
had dialysis on ___. His symptoms improved and he was 
discharged home able to ambulate. His INR was still 
subtherapeutic and his dose was increased for review at the ___ 
___ clinic. Of note, on telemetry during dialysis he 
appeared to have a short episode of AF.

on ___ but was incapable due to his acute gout flare. 
Electrolytes were stable ___ and hence there was no need for 
emergent dialysis. He had dialysis on ___ and notably had a 
possible episode of AF in dialysis with no symptoms of this. He 
continued on his ___ regime with next dialysis due 
___. Given his gout flare, his allopurinol dose was increased 
to 100mg qd and renal team agreed with starting a low dose ACEI. 
He was discharged on ___ after his dialysis.

# Gout flare: Pt was on renally dosed allopurinol at 100mg 
alternate days. He presented with multifocal gout symptoms with 
pain in the left wrist and left ankle  and by assessment in 
hospital, his pain at the base of the right thumb had resolved. 
He was initially treated with colchicine and indomethacin in the 
ED with symptomatic improvement and this was not continued on 
transfer to the ward. Following initiation of prednisone 40mg, 
his pain improved such that he was able to ambulate although 
still had residual pain in his left wrist on movement. His uric 
acid level was 5.3. He should complete a 5 day course of 
prednisone and will be seen by his PCP ___ ___.
.
# h/o Atrial fibrillation on warfarin s/p cardioversion: 
Amiodarione was stopped as this was felt to be contributing to 
bradycardia/long QT. INR was subtherapeutic at 1.5. Of 
particular note, he had an episode of possible AF while on 
dialysis and reverted back to SR. Given his low INR, we 
increased his warfarin to 5mg on ___ and ___ and is for lab 
review on ___ at ___ clinic.
.
# New deranged LFTs: This was felt likely secondary to 
amiodarone. Statin and amiodarone were stopped on ___. On this 
admission, his LFTs had further improved to ALT 167 AST 107. He 
should be seen as an out-patient by hepatology.
.
# Sinus Bradycardia/Prolonged QTc:  Amiodarone was stopped on 
___ during his previous admission as was 
Carvedilol after an episode of symptomatic bradycardia at HD. He 
was monitored on telemetry and his blood pressure was never 
compromised. He awaits cardiology review as per previous 
discharge summary.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___, 

You were admitted for back and chest pain.  Fortunately, there 
was no evidence of a heart attack based on blood tests 
evaluating your cardiac enzymes, which are released when there 
is injury to the heart muscle.

You underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed stenosis of 
your previous stent (in the diagonal artery), and a chronic 
blockage of a native artery (the left circumflex artery).  
Unfortunately, while they were able to dilate the blockage with 
a balloon, they were unable to place a stent.  

We made some medication changes to treat your coronary artery 
disease.  Please see the attached medication sheet for details.  
The interventional cardiologists recommended a second attempt at 
percutaneous intervention in ___.  

It was a pleasure being involved in your care, 
Your ___ Care Team

Pertinent Results:
Imaging:
===========
___  CardiovascularECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. There is mild symmetric left ventricular 
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic 
function (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic 
function is likely more depressed given the severity of mitral 
regurgitation.] The estimated cardiac index is normal 
(>=2.5L/min/m2). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta 
are mildly dilated. An aortic ___ prosthesis is present 
The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal 
leaflet motion and transvalvular gradients. Trace aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately 
thickened. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. 
[Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation 
may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The end-diastolic 
pulmonic regurgitation velocity is increased suggesting 
pulmonary artery diastolic hypertension. There is a 
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Well seated, normal functioning ___ aortic 
bioprosthesis with normal gradient and trace aortic 
regurgitation. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery 
hypertension. 

Endoscopy:
==========
___ Colonoscopy
Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, descending colon, 
transverse colon and ascending colon
Active bleeding from a Dieulafoy's at the IC valve. (thermal 
therapy)
Otherwise normal colonoscopy to cecum

___ EGD
Medium hiatal hernia
Linear ulcerations within the hital hernia consistent with 
camerons ulcers.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,

You were admitted for a drop in your blood level. Upon your 
arrival, we transfused you with 2 units of blood. We suspected 
that your low blood level was the result of bleeding in your 
gastrointestinal tract. To determine the location of this 
bleeding, we performed a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy. 
The colonoscopy showed bleeding from a lesion at the junction 
between your small and large intestine, which was then 
successfully stopped with cauterization. Afterwards, your blood 
levels remained stable. You also required oxygen therapy this 
admission given your chronic lung issues. You were followed 
closely by the cardiology team that performed your recent aortic 
valve intervention, and they deemed you stable as well. 

Please follow-up with your Cardiology and pulmonary specialists 
as indicated below. In addition, your rehabilitation facility 
will schedule follow-up with your primary care physician.

Thank you for allowing us to be a part of your medical care.

Sincerely,

Your ___ Care Team

IMAGING
CXR ___
Tracheostomy tube again noted as well as the left arm access 
PICC line.  The tip of the PICC line resides at the junction of 
the brachiocephalic and SVC.  Cardiomegaly is re- demonstrated.  
Subtle lower lung opacities may reflect the presence of small 
effusions and atelectasis, cannot exclude pneumonia/ aspiration. 
 No overt evidence for edema.  No large pneumothorax is seen.  
Multiple old left rib deformities are again seen. 

CXR ___
As compared to the previous examination, no relevant change is 
seen.  Mild bilateral basal areas of opacities.  Old left-sided 
rib fractures. Moderate cardiomegaly persists.  No relevant 
change in position of the tracheostomy tube. 

ECG ___
Probable atrial fibrillation with moderate ventricular response 
of 77 beats per minute. Early R wave transition. Non-specific ST 
segment flattening. Borderline low limb lead voltage. Compared 
to the previous tracing of ___ the ventricular rate is slower 
and the suggestion of ischemic ST-T wave changes is no longer 
appreciated. 

MICROBIOLOGY
Urine culture ___: yeast
BAL ___: No organisms on gram stain; No growth to date on 
culture
Blood cultures NGTD
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o male with tracheostomy and PEG, severe COPD, HFpEF, 
atrial arrhythmias s/p cardioversionx2 in ___ and ___, 
currently on coumadin, obesity s/p laparoscopic band surgery. He 
presents from LTAC with tachypnea.

# Respiratory failure: Patient presented from LTAC with 
tachypnea in setting of being weaned from pressure support to 
trach mask. Here, he was put on CMV with significant clinical 
improvement. Respiratory failure was thought most likely 
secondary to rapid weaning from ventilator with contribution of 
volume overload (BNP 7000). Infection was considered but he 
remained afebrile without purulent sputum. CXR with no 
infiltrate. He was transitioned to pressure support, given 
outpatient lasix and metolazone and diuresed approximately 1.5 
L. He underwent bronchoscopy which showed frothy fluid 
suggestive of pulmonary edema without any purulence or plugging; 
BAL cultures are no growth to date. At discharge patient was 
again weaning from pressure support to trach T-piece and 
tolerating this well.
-please monitor weights and fluid status; uptitrate lasix as 
necessary
-use t-piece for trach mask trials as tolerated
-use ET-tube suction catheter for extra long trach

# Upper extremity DVT: Patient on warfarin for DVT of left 
cephalic vein noted ___. Occlusive proximal left cephalic 
vein thrombus. On admission INR was 3.6 and warfarin was held. 
At discharge INR was 3.6.
-Please restart warfarin when INR is subtherapeutic
-Please start subcutaneous heparin for prophylaxis if warfarin 
continues to be held

# Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: Patient in sinus rhythm or 
with wandering atrial pacemaker throughout this admission. Home 
metoprolol tartrate 50 mg q8h was continued. Warfarin was held 
in setting of supratherapeutic INR and pending ___ procedure.

# Diastolic heart failure: Patient continued on outpatient 
furosemide 40 mg daily and metolazone 2.5 mg daily with diuresis 
of 1.5 L.
 
# History of coag negative staph from blood cultures. Patient on 
vancomycin ___ through ___ per infectious disease note. He was 
continued on vancomycin in house. Of note vancomycin level was 
32 on ___ and thus dose was held.
-please restart vanc AM of ___ at 1g Q24H and recheck trough 
before third dose.

# Anxiety and depression: Continued outpatient venlafaxine and 
lamotrigine.

Transitional issues:
#INR 3.6 on ___: holding coumadin, please restart when INR <3
#Vanc trough 32 on AM of ___. Vanc dose held. Restart at 1g 
Q24H on ___ in the AM. Recheck trough before 3rd dose.
#Please monitor weight and fluid status and uptitration lasix 
prn
#Please continue weaning to trach mask as tolerated
#Respiratory recommends using a T piece as opposed to trach mask 
for weaning, and to use ET tube suction catheter, as his trach 
tube is extra long. 
#Acetylcysteine added for mucolysis

hypotension.  
.  
Via family it appears pt woke up this morning feeling very 
lightheaded and dizzy, she decided to go an see her PCP. At the 
PCP's office she was noted to be in A.fib with a rate in the 
120s-130s as well as a sytolic blood pressure of 95. Pt was then 
referred directly to the ED given her heart rate and symptomatic 
hypotension.  
.  
She does endorse the sensation of palpations but it appears she 
has had this sensation for a long time and she denies any 
worsening of it recently. She denies any difficulty breathing, 
chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fevers 
or chills. She does endorse feeling very thirsty over the past 
few days, however per the daughter the pt always feels thirsty 
and appears more swollen to her. She has also, per PCP referral, 
had ___ 9lb weight gain.  
.  
In the ED an EKG showed she was in A.fib with a rate in the 
110s, she also received a chest x-ray which per the ED read 
looked mildly fluid overloaded. She felt very thirsty and so had 
some PO fluids, in the ED she received <500 of IVF. Prior to 
transfer her vitals ranged from BP 100->110, HR 110-118 RR 20,

Brief Hospital Course:
IN SUMMARY
 ___ y.o. Female with history of diastolic CHF, A. fib on 
Coumadin, HTN, HL, CRI presenting with A. fib with intermittent 
RVR and hypotension. On admission, she was given less beta and 
calcium channel blockade than that of her home regimen. 
Nevertheless, she has been rate controlled since arrival on the 
floor save for two episodes. At 0200 on ___, the patient had 
an episode of asymptomatic bradycardia (39) with sinus pause and 
a BP of 120/70. At 0900 on ___ the patient went back into RVR 
after a stressful conversation with her husband. Despite that, 
the patient has been clinically stable with stable blood 
pressures and largely rate controlled with a persistently 
negative fluid balance. On ___ we transitioned her back to her 
home dose of diltiazem. On ___ AM, we transitioned her back on 
atenolol, but quickly returned to ___ when she went into 
RVR. EP was consulted. They discussed her at conference and 
decided that she must optimize her weight, thyroid, sleep apnea 
status prior to anti-arrythmic. She was ___ Litres negative by 
the time of discharge. She was discharged on 75 mg Toprol XL and 
Dilt XL 240 mg BID. We tried to get her ___ of Hearts monitor 
but she refused. An Rx will left in OMR and she was counselled 
for 60 minutes total on the importance of this device
.  
BY PROBLEM 

1) A. fib with RVR: Pt noted to vary with her a. fib ranging 
from ___ with no evidence of flash pulmonary edema. It is 
unclear as to the recent cause of the A. fib with RVR as it 
appears pt has been compliant with her medications. On 
admission, patient was taken off of 25 mg Atenolol and put on 
Metoprolol Tartrate 25mg PO TID. We attempted to put her back on 
atenolol and she went back into RVR. She was started on 
Diltiazem 90mg PO QID given her relative hypotension and 
increased back to home dose (given improved BP) of 120mg QID (Pt 
takes 480mg per 24 hours). She was kept on tele, with on episode 
of asymptomatic bradycardia with sinus pauses. She was kept on 
Coumadin, on which was therapeutic. EP was consulted. They 
discussed her at conference and decided that she must optimize 
her weight, thyroid, sleep apnea status prior to anti-arrythmic. 
They believe that, for now, she should move toward beta-blockade 
predominant regimen while down-titrating the diltiazem.

2). Hypotension: Unclear if this is related to her episodes of 
A. fib with RVR. Given her diastolic dysfunction it is likely 
that once pt goes into A. fib with RVR she does not have 
enoought time to fill her ventricles and thus reduces her 
cardiac output. However it appears that is sometimes hypotensive 
irrespective of the RVR. Her BNP was mildly elevated especially 
when compared to her prior results. Her gain in weight, body 
edema and exquisite response to diuresis would point to an 
extravascular fluid overload state. Given that she was 
hypotensive, the original goal currently is to control her A. 
fib; holding her diuretics and lisinopril. Given her stability, 
we began actively diuresing her the day after admission. We held 
her lisinopril on discharge as her pressures were never greater 
than 130/70 
.  
3) Diastolic CHF with EF > 60%- pt's fluid status was never 
clear, clinically. Her lungs were clear and her pitting edema 
was far from impressive. Nevertheless, her obese abdomen may 
have had extra fluid. We used her daily oral dose of lasix with 
prn IV boluses of 20 mg IV to diurese. Patient tolerated this 
well, her fluid balance was between negative 4 and 5 litres 
(nursin notes incomplete with respect to ins). By ___ she 
was in contraction alkalosis with a slight bump in creatinine. 
We stopped the IV lasix and encouraged PO replacement. She may 
need to be put back on an ACEi when her rate control regime is 
worked out. 

4) Hypothyroidism: Was continued on home regimen of 
Levothyroxine. Midway through the admission, we checked the TSH 
as a cause of her presenting Afib. It turns out that she is 
HyPOthyroid and has had elevated TSH for months. We did not dare 
increase her thyroid replacement dosage until her rate/rhythm 
control regime is decided. Clearly, this could exacerbate her 
heart failure. 
.  
5) OSA: sleep apnea and the consequent catecholamine excess may 
be related to her RVR. She must continue BiPAP every night. She 
refused it while in the hospital

6) DM II: Patient on 70/30 BID, ISS on CBGs QID and glipidzide. 

TO BE RESOLVED
1) AFIB WITH RVR - optimize thyroid, weight loss and OSA tx. EP 
reccommended more beta block and less calcium channel
2) Hypothyroidism - pt may need increase in thyroid replacement 
dose and close monitoring
3) Obesity - patient may need professional nutritional 
intervention.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old man with symptomatic right carotid stenosis was 
brought to the operating room on ___ and underwent a right 
carotid endarterectomy.  The procedure was without 
complications. Postoperatively, he had several issues. 

1.TIA
On POD # 1 he developed a mild fluent expressive aphasia, 
significant for neologisms, with paraphasic errors (word 
substitution) and slight right facial asymmetry and dysarthria, 
without other focal deficits. MRI showed a New small foci of 
slow diffusion, in the left parietal lobe, which may  relate to 
small acute infarcts and stable small acute-subacute infarct in 
the right internal capsule. 
His symptoms completely resolved within a few hours after being 
started on a Heparin infusion.  Later in the day patient was 
noted to have new right neck swelling requiring surgical 
revision with hematoma evacuation.

disorder and chronic kidney disease stage IV that was admitted 
for reported worsening renal function and a fall in her 
hematocrit.  Her Creatinine on admission was 2.8.  Urine culture 
was negative for infection and the urinalysis was unremarkable.  
She was started on IVF on admission as pt appeared dehydrated 
and Cr decreased from 2.8->2.5->2.3 on discharge.  Upon 
obtaining records from her Nephrologist Dr. ___ became 
aware the the pt has chronic kidney disease with a Cr of 2.4 in 
___.  Therefore it appears that the pt is at or slightly below 
her baseline renal function, which is chronically impaired 
reported secondary to a history of lithium toxicity.

#Acute kidney Injury - Her Creatinine on admission was 2.8.  
Urine culture was negative for infection and the urinalysis was

with current regimen including PO clozapine and IM risperidone. 
He was reported to be denying his medications in the ___ weeks 
prior to admission, believing himself to be entirely well and 
his medications to be toxic. 

On the day prior to admission, he was reportedly in his usual 
state of health and took his medications for the day. After 
smoking a cigarette, he returned to his room to lie down in bed. 
Some time later, he was found unresponsive, including to tactile 
stimuli, by his nursing team, who noted him to be flaccid and 
drooling, with gurgling and frothing at his mouth, but no 
urinary or fecal incontinence. Vital signs at that time included 
systolic blood pressure in the ___ and heart rate in the 130s in 
association with fingerstick blood glucose of 153.  

At ___, labs were notable for sodium of 
127, CK of 1593, and negative toxicology screen. EKG was within 
normal limits with nonprolonged QTc. Noncontrast head CT head 
was negative, as was CTA chest. On transfer to ___ ED, CTA 
head and neck were negative. However, he required intubation for 
airway protection protection prior to admission to the MICU, 
where he was extubated soon after arrival and alert and oriented 
x3, calm without complaint.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ with intractable paranoid schizophrenia, 
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cerebrovascular accident 
without residual deficits who was found to be unresponsive in 
bed at his group home.

Active Issues:
# Loss of consciousness: The cause of his loss of consciousness 
was not entirely clear, but was felt in discussion with the 
psychiatry service to be most likely oversedation from multiple 
antipsychotic medications. IM risperidone monotherapy, with 
discontinuation of PO risperidone and PO clozapine, was advised 
henceforward to avoid oversedation. Noncontrast head CT was 
negative for acute intracranial pathology while CTA chest was 
negative for pulmonary embolism or other thoracic pathology. 
There was low suspicion for acute coronary syndrome in the 
absence of acute ischemic EKG changes or troponinemia, and 
cardiac arrhythmia, particularly Torsades in the setting of 
multiple QTc prolonging agents, was felt to be unlikely, given 
nonprolonged QTc on admission and no further events on 
telemetry. In the setting of mild hyponatremia, EEG was negative 
for seizure activity. He was reportedly euglycemic when found 
unresponsive at his nursing, effectively precluding 
hypo/hyperglycemic episode. While he required intubation for 
airway protection in the ___ ED, he was extubated soon after 
arrival to the MICU and remained alert and oriented x3, calm, 
and appropriately interactive without recollection of his reason 
for admission throughout the remainder of admission.   

# Hyponatremia: Mild hyponatremia to 127 likely reflected 
hypovolemic hyponatremia, given improvement to 133 at discharge 
following gentle IV hydration.  

# Paranoid schizophrenia: As above, oversedation from multiple 
antipsychotic medications was felt to be most likely responsible 
for transient unresponsiveness. In discussion with the 
psychiatry service, IM risperidone monotherapy, with 
discontinuation of PO risperidone and PO clozapine, was advised 
henceforward to avoid oversedation. Following extubation, he 
remained alert and oriented x3, calm, and appropriately 
interactive without recollection of his reason for admission 
throughout the remainder of admission.   

Inactive Issues:
# Diabetes mellitus: Home oral regimen was held in favor of 
Humalog insulin sliding scale in house, with resumption of home 
glipizide and metformin at discharge.

# Hypertension: Home metoprolol and lisinopril were continued 
throughout admission.

# Hyperlipidemia: Home simvastatin was continued.

# GERD: Home omeprazole was continued.

Transitional Issues:
* Avoidance of PO clozapine and PO risperidone is advised by the 
psychiatry service to prevent oversedation.
* Thyroid ultrasound is advised for further evaluation of 
incidentally noted thyroid isthmus prominence on CTA head/neck.
* Hematuria on multiple urinalyses is presumed secondary to 
traumatic Foley insertion, but repeat urinalysis is advised in 
the outpatient setting to ensure resolution of hematuria.
* Pending studies: Blood cultures x2 (___).
* Code status: Full.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking part in your care during your admission 
to ___. As you know, you were 
admitted because you were found unresponsive and unconscious in 
your bed at your group home. You were intubated to make sure you 
could continue breathing safely, and then mechanically 
ventilated (a machine breathed for you for a few hours). You 
were transfered to the ICU, where you were extubated. The 
psychiatry team evaluated you and decided that the event was 
most likely due to too much antipsychotic medication, and they 
recommended that you take only Risperdal and not Clozaril. 

We wish you all the best in the future.

the indwelling ureteral stent.

-The kidney stone may or may not have been removed AND/or there 
may fragments/others still in the process of passing.

-You may experience some pain associated with spasm of your 
ureter. This is normal. Take the narcotic pain medication as 
prescribed if additional pain relief is needed. Flomax is also 
prescribed and will help with stent-related pain and stone 
passage

-Ureteral stents MUST be removed or exchanged and therefore it 
is IMPERATIVE that you follow-up as directed. 

-Do not lift anything heavier than a phone book (10 pounds) 

-You may continue to periodically see small amounts of blood in 
your urine--this is normal and will gradually improve

-Resume all of your pre-admission medications, except HOLD

Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o female with hepatitis C cirrhosis and HCC recently listed 
for liver transplant who received an offer for liver transplant. 
The patient was taken to the OR with Dr ___ who 
performed the hepatectomy, and Dr ___ who completed 
the transplant.
There were no complications reported during the surgery, and she 
received four liters crystalloid, 1 unit of FFP, 500 mg of 
albumin. She was transferred to the surgical ICU still intubated 
but stable.
The patient received routine induction immunosuppression to 
include 500 mg solumedrol intra-op, cellcept prior to the 
surgery. Tacrolimus was started on the evening of POD 1.

On Post day 0 a liver ultrasound was obtained showing patent 
hepatic arteries immediately post-transplant, but arterial 
waveforms are moderately abnormal with reduced resistive 
indices, though preserved rate of systolic upstroke.
Liver function tests intially increased significatly, however 
they have trended down daily except the alk phos which was 
trending down, then on POD 3 it has started to increase again. 
It was stably elevated to 210 on POD 4 and 5, Total bilirubin 
was 0.8 on POD 5.

Follow up ultrasounds were performed on POD 1, POD 2 and POD 4. 
The ultrasound on POD 4 reports ""Patent hepatic vasculature with 
improved arterial waveforms"". 

Patient received routine induction immunosuppression following 
solumedrol taper and transition to oral prednisone, she remains 
on 1 gram BID of cellcept, and tacrolimus levels have been drawn 
daily with adjustments to dosing per level.

The patient has been advanced to a regular diet with good 
tolerance, is ambulating easily and is cleared for home. She has 
received the transplant teaching manual and medications have 
been reviewed with nursing, pharmacist and coordinators. Of note 
the patient has been struggling with constipation and was sent 
home with an aggressive bowel regimen.

On POD 5 she was noted to have increased LFTs across the board, 
and another liver ultrasound was obtained. Per the ultrasound 
report; Patent hepatic vasculature.  There is a region of 
turbulent high velocity arterial flow in the anterior right lobe 
of the liver contaminated with venous flow.  This appearance is 
consistent with an AV fistula.  
The following day the LFTs were still elevated but stable from 
the previous day.

The patient was otherwise doing very well and it was determined 
she could be discharged to home with lab followup 2 days 
following discharge.

LIVER U/S: The liver appears normal in echotexture without focal 
masses or 
lesions. The previously described right lobe cyst was not 
identified on this examination. Normal flow and waveforms were 
seen within the main portal vein, left and right portal veins. 
Normal flow and waveforms are seen within the main hepatic 
artery. Normal flow and waveforms are seen within the right, 
middle, and left hepatic veins and within the IVC. Flow is 
present within the splenic vein. There is no biliary ductal 
dilatation. 
IMPRESSION: Normal liver vasculature. 
.
___ U/S: 1. No evidence for DVT. 
2. Bilateral ___ cysts, left greater than right. 
.
LIVER BIOPSY:
Liver, needle core biopsy:
Mild portal and lobular inflammation consisting of lymphocytes 
and rare neutrophils, with scattered apoptotic hepatocytes. No 
significant periportal extension/piecemeal necrosis identified.
Foci of dystrophic bile ductular damage with a rare ductular 
infiltrating lymphocyte and rare apoptotic biliary epithelial 
cell. No ductular proliferation seen.
Mild intrahepatocytic and canalicular cholestasis.
No increased steatosis or centrivenular injury identified.
Trichrome stain demonstrates no definite increase in fibrosis.
Iron stain shows mild iron deposition in Kupffer cells.
Note:  The features are consistent with hepatic involvement by 
acute graft host disease. The apoptotic hepatocytes present in 
this case are most likely related to the GVHD (this finding is 
particularly prominent in those cases with a more hepatitic 
presentation), however, a concomitant drug effect cannot be 
entirely excluded. An acute viral hepatitis is unlikely 
(particularly given negative serologies and viral loads). Dr. ___. 
___ notified Dr. ___ of the findings on ___. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ year old male with a history of multiple myeloma s/p multiple 
treatments, including numerous chemotherapy regimens, Autologous 
transplant in ___, mini-MUD allogeneic transplant in ___, 
and DLI x4, most recently on ___, presenting from clinic 
with elevated LFTs and a direct hyperbilirubinemia.  
.  
#. Elevated LFTs/Hyperbilirubinemia: Possible etiologies on 
admission included portal vein clot, Budd-chiari, IVC clot, 
pericarditis, medications, Liver GVHD, hepatitis. Patient had 
negative Hepatitis viral loads in ___.  Levofloxacin and 
atovaquone were discontinued on admission as these can cause 
hepatic failure.  Liver u/s with dopplers showed no clots in the 
liver vasculature and a normal hepatobiliary tree.  Patient's 
LFTs remained elevated, thus decision was made to obtain a liver 
biopsy.  The liver biopsy showed findings consistent with acute 
GVHD of the liver.  Patient was discharged on MMF 250 mg TID, 
and prednisone 30 mg PO daily.
.
#. Eye dryness:  On admission, patient c/o of a ""sandpapery"" 
feeling on the eyes.  Patient will make an appointment to see 
ophtho for evaluation of GVH of the eye.  He was discharged on 
polyvinyl alcohol-povidone eye drops and will follow-up with 
ophtho in the clinic.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ admitted to the thoracic surgery service following a right 
VATS wedge resection x3 for pulmonary nodules concerning for 
metastatic foci of melanoma, please see separate operative 
dictation for details of procedure. 
Post-operatively he was taken to the PACU for recovery, where he 
had rapid ventricular response (has chronic afib) that required 
a diltiazem drip for a few hours following evening 
administration of his usual oral rate control medications. The 
morning of POD 1 his HR was under control on oral medicines and 
he
subsequently transferred to the floor. His initial post-op CXR 
showed a right chest tube in place and no evidence of 
pneumothorax. His diet was advanced to regular, he was placed on 
his home medications, and his pain was controlled with oxycodone 
and tylenol. On POD 1 he had no air leak and was clinically 
doing well, so his right chest tube was removed and the 
post-pull CXR showed minimal right pneumothorax in the apex. He 
was restarted on his home coumadin for Afib. On POD 2 his O2 
saturations did fall in to the high 80's in the early morning 
requiring supplemental O2, but he was given a dose of lasix and 
by mid-day his SPO2 was around 90-91% on RA at rest and he did 
not have any issues with desaturating while walking. A repeat 
CXR was performed that showed no interval change in the small 
right apical PTX, and he continued to do well clinically with 
stable vital signs.  He was ambulating and voiding without 
assistance, tolerating a regular 
diet, and his pain was controlled with PO pain medicines, so he 
was deemed stable for discharge home with follow-up in thoracic 
surgery clinic with Dr. ___.

Imaging:

IMPRESSION: No fracture or malalignment of the cervical spine. 
Moderate 
degenerative changes of the mid-to-lower cervical spine. 

CT head:
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial abnormality.

Right Ankle 2 view xray:
There is a horizontal nondisplaced intra-articular fracture 
involving the medial malleolus and a vertical fracture of the 
lateral aspect of the distal tibial metaphysis extending 
inferiorly to the articular surface, with minimal lateral 
displacement of the fracture fragment. There is possible 
extension of this fracture into the posterior malleolus as the 
posterior malleolar cortex is slightly irregular. Evaluation of 
the ankle mortise is limited secondary to the projection of the 
film. Also noted is a comminuted spiral fracture of the distal 
fibular diaphysis terminating medially approximately 2.4 cm 
proximal to the tibial plafond. There may be a small joint 
effusion identified. The bones are diffusely osteopenic. No 
foreign bodies are identified. 

Comminuted distal fibular fracture and intra-articular fractures 
involving the medial malleolus and lateral distal tibial 
metaphysis, with probable extension into the posterior malleolus 
as detailed above. 

Repeated: 

A plaster cast has been placed and obscures underlying fine bony 
detail. Additionally, there is baseline osteopenia. As best can 
be noted, there has been no significant interval change in the 
minimally displaced fractures involving the medial malleolus and 
the distal fibular diaphysis, as previously described. Slight 
widening medially of the ankle mortise is again present and 
relatively unchanged. The details of the fracture, particularly 
the involvement of the lateral aspect of the distal tibia are 
not well seen, in part due to the overlying casting material. 
  
IMPRESSION: No significant interval change in the minimally 
displaced 
fractures previously described. 

Repeated again:
Right ankle xray:
There is an overlying cast which limits fine bony detail. There 
is again seen a fracture involving the distal fibula, 4 cm above 
the tibiotalar joint. There is some widening of the medial ankle 
mortise. 

Hip xray:
No evidence of acute traumatic injury to the right hip.

CXR:
IMPRESSION: 
No signs of acute cardiopulmonary process. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: ___ yo F w/ DM2, HTN, HL parkinsons dz, CRI 
s/p unwitnessed mechanical fall at ___, found on floor by staff

fibula, no radiographic evidence of improvement after attempted 
reductions. Per ortho, non-weightbearing in RLE x 6 weeks, no 
surgery, keep current cast on until appointment on ___, 
at which point she will have recasting.  No evidence of other 
fractures. Patient placed on calcium and vitamin D. Pain control 
was with standing tylenol (should be reevaluated on weekly 
basis) and PRN oxycodone Q4-6 hours (should be monitored for 
confusion/sedation/changes in respiratory status). Patient will 
need to continue lovenox 30mg Q24 while non weight-bearing. 
Patient needs to be seen by physical therapy in rehab.

.  
# Falls: Patient describes mechanical fall, possibly secondary 
to postural hypotension from ___. She was discharged on 
___, and should consider ___ as outpatient as 
recommended by geriatrics team. 
.
# Acute on chronic kidney disease: Creatinine slowly trended up 
from 1.2 to 1.5 (baseline 1.2-1.5), but then remained stable.

fluid resuscitation. HCTZ was stopped, ___ was continued because 
creatinine stable on day of discharge.  
. 
# HTN: Blood pressure elevated as high as 180s systolic while 
inhouse and asymptomatic (but BP's fluctuated, possibly ___ 
positional changes and pain), continued on ___, metoprolol XL. 
HCTZ stopped and she was started on norvasc 5mg daily. Her 
systolic blood pressures were in the 140's to 150's at the time 
of discharge. 
.
# Chest pain: On ___, patient c/o ___ pain in chest, stated 
it felt like she was in the wrong position. No 
N/V/SOB/diaphoresis/radiation. DDx is musculoskeletal vs. ACS 
vs. PE (given fracture/immobility). EKG with no changes (old T 
wave inversion in V1, otherwise NSR), CE's negative. Low 
suspicion for PE b/c no evidence of right heart strain on EKG, 
no tachycardia. Most likely musculoskeletal given 
reproducibility on palpation.  Pain resolved with tylenol.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ on ___ because you had a fall and 
fractured your right ankle. You were seen by the orthopedic 
surgeons who did not think that you needed surgery. Instead, you 
will need to remain in a cast for 6 weeks and you cannot bear 
weight on your right leg until that time. You need to take a 
blood thinner everyday for the next six weeks to prevent a blood 
clot from going to your lungs while you aren't moving around 
very much.
 

 
While you were here, you also had some chest pain, but we did a 
heart tracing and blood testing to be sure it was not a heart 
attack. This testing was all normal, and we think the pain is 
probably from muscle strain because of the way you were lying in 
bed.
 

 
The following changes were made to your medications:
 
1. STOP taking HCTZ
 
2. START taking norvasc 5mg daily
 
3. STOP taking trazodone
 
4. DECREASE your xanax from 0.5mg to 0.25mg, and eventually try 
to STOP this medication. It can be dangerous in elderly 
patients. Never drink alcohol or drive with this medication.
 
5. START taking calcium and vitamin D for your bones
 
6. START taking tylenol ___ every 6 hours 
 
7. START taking oxycodone 5mg every ___ hours as needed for 
pain. Never drink alcohol or drive with this medication.
 
8. START taking colace and senna to help move your bowels. TAKE 
miralax as needed for constipation if these aren't working.
 
9. START lovenox daily; continue for 6 weeks while 
non-weightbearing (reassess with orthopedic surgeon at your next 
office)

알레르기: 환자가 약물에 대한 알레르기를 가지고 있다고 기록하였다.
진료 담당자는 ____이다.
주요 소견은 넘어졌다.
수술이나 침습적 절차는 오른쪽 하지의 캐스팅이었다.
병력: 요즘까지 DM2를 가진 여성으로서 HTN을 가졌으며 HL과 파킨슨 병이 있었다. CRI로 불참했다. 최근에는 우울증이 있었고, 그 결과 오늘날도 계속해서 우울감을 느끼고 있다. 또한, 지난번에 발생한 부상으로 인해 현재는 통증 때문에 걸음걸이를 할 수 없다. 두통이나 무의식 상태가 없었다. 그녀는 화장실에서 떨어져서 직원이 그녀를 발견했고, 그녀의 발목을 잡아 세웠다. 그녀는 도중에 목욕탕에서 떨어지면서 손발이 얼룩덜러지는 것을 보였다. 이후에도 계속하여 치료받았다. 그리고 지금은 아직도 계속되어 있다. 그녀는 기침약을 복용하고 있으며, 항상 다리 위에 앉아서 시간을 보내고 있다.
혈액검사결과: 혈압은 높았으나 심각하지 않았다. 그러나 이틀 후에는 다시 내려갔다. 그리고 다음 날 아침에는 더 이상의 증상을 나타내지 않았다. 그리고 마지막으로, 그녀는 과거에 여러 차례 같은 일을 겪었다. 그리고 이번에도 마찬가지였다. 그리고 이제는 더욱더 그러하다. 그리고 그녀는 또 다른 일들을 경험했지만, 그것들은 모두 이전보다 덜했다. 그리고 그녀에게는 더 이상 그런 일이 일어날 가능성이 거의 없다고 생각된다. 그리고 그녀의 몸은 매우 건강하였고, 특히 그녀의 마음속에서는 많은 변화가 있었다. 그리고 그곳에서도 그녀는 자신의 몸을 잘 돌보고 있었다. 하지만, 그녀의 몸 속에는 작은 상처가 있어야 했다. 그리고 그것은 그녀의 신체 활동량을 줄여 주었고, 그녀의 체중도 증가되었다. 그리고 아마도 그녀의 뇌와 관련된 문제들도 있을 것이다. 그리고 그의 경우에는 그녀의 뼈가 깨끗하게 생겼다. 그리고 그는 자신의 몸을 움직이는 데 어려움을 겪기도 했는데, 이는 그가 너무 많이 먹어서 그렇다. 그래서 그는 자신의 몸무게를 조절해야 한다. 그리고 만약 그가 자신들의 몸을 움직인다면, 그의 몸은 더 나빠질 것이다. 따라서 그는 자신의 행동을 조절할 필요가 있다. 그리고 이것은 그의 삶에 큰 영향을 미칠 것이다."

CXR ___:  
FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. 
There is interval placement of a right-sided PICC, terminating 
in the distal SVC/cavoatrial junction. Bibasilar opacities, new 
since ___ are seen, which could relate to atelectasis, 
aspiration, and/or infection. No pleural effusion or 
pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are 
stable. 
. 
CT chest ___:  
1. Even if the majority of multiple subcentimeter pulmonary 
nodules new since ___, are due to the bronchial 
inflammation or infection seen in the left lung, there is still 
a sufficient number of nodules in areas free of inflammation, to 
raise concern for metastasis from reported hepatocellular 
carcinoma. The lesions are too small to promise differentiation 
of malignancy from infection by PET scanning. Depending upon 
clinical circumstances, surveillance may be the most reasonable 
approach, with a repeat scan in no more than three months. 
2. Mild, non-pathologic thoracic vertebral compression 
fractures, new since ___. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ male with HCV/EtOH cirrhosis c/b ___ s/p cyberknife, 
transferred from prison for recently diagnosed pneumonia with 
PICC line, found to have multiple pulmonary nodules concerning 
for metastatic spread of HCC.    
.  
# Chest pain:  Patient admitted with pleuritic chest pain 
following 4 days of zosyn for pneumonia diagnosed at an outside 
hospital.  He was noted on admission to have a large hematoma 
overlying his left chest with nodularity that likely is the 
cause of his chest pain, possibly pleuritic due to splinting.  
On admission, he did not have any fevers, cough, or leukocytosis 
to support a current pneumonia.  His EKG was unchanged from 
baseline, and his resting and ambulatory saturations remained 
stable on room air.  The patient underwent CXR that showed 
nodular bibasilar infiltrates.  He then underwent a CT scan to 
further evaluate lung parenchyma that showed multiple small 
nodules concerning for metastatic malignancy, without evidence 
of pneumonia.  Zosyn was stopped after a 5 day course (day 2 of 
admission) and PICC was pulled.  Given likely primary malignancy 
of HCC, the patient's AFP was checked, and showed increase from 
2295 to 2561 after cyberknife therapy (a sharp trend up from AFP 
275 in ___.  Oncology was consulted for workup of nodules and 
recommended repeat CT scan in 2 months, as nodules are currently 
too small to biopsy.  Patient is not yet a candidate for 
systemic chemotherapy as he recently underwent cyberknife.  The 
patient will follow up with his primary care physician on 
discharge for monitoring of his left chest hematoma and 
monitoring of his respiratory status.  He will follow up with 
his hepatologist and radiation/oncologist regarding his likely 
metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.  A repeat CT chest was 
scheduled prior to discharge for 2 months from discharge.  
.    
# HCV/EtOH cirrhosis, complicated by Hepatocellular carcinoma: 
Chronic.  Patient is status post cyberknife for ___ with repeat 
procedure scheduled for end of ___. On admission, the 
patient had mild jaundice with chronically elevated T. bili (at 
baseline).  He was without evidence of further decompensation.  
During admission, the patient was found to have multiple 
pulmonary nodules concerning for metastatic HCC, as above.  The 
patient's hepatologist and radiaton oncologist were made aware 
of the new findings.  The patient was continued on home nadolol. 
 He will follow up with his hepatologist and radiation 
oncologist as previously scheduled.  
.
# Pancytopenia:  Patient with chronic mild pancytopenia with 
predominant thrombocytopenia likely due to cirrhosis.  It 
remained stable throughout admission.  
.
# DM2: Chronic.  The patient was continued on home glargine.  He 
was maintained on an insulin sliding scale while in house.    
.  
# HTN: Chronic.  The patient remained normotensive throughout 
admission.  He was continued on lasix and nadolol.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ yo man with history of HCV cirrhosis (genotype 1, never 
treated), c/b ascites, extremity edema, HE (no known varices, 
last EGD as OSH ___, DM/ HTN/HL, CVA, PVD, COPD, neuropathy 
and MMP who presents to ___ with weight gain, lower extremity 
swelling, and fatigue since discharge.
.
#. Hyponatremia: Admission labs demonstrated Na 120, down from 
125 at recent discharge. Patient reported increase in  weight 
since discharge. He had profound edema in ___ and in the abdomen 
(subcutaneous) with minimal ascites (insufficient for the tap).  
The impression was that his overall fluid status was partially 
due to cirrhosis, however with a component of RHF (question 
cirrhotic CM vs. pulm HTN or combination). His Na improved to 
125 with fluid restriction (<1200 cc) and discontinuation of 
diuretics.  He had a moderate self diuresis of 2L despite 
holding diuretics. He was continued on Tolvaptan at prior dose. 
He was discharged home with plans for outpatient echo and 
outpatient sleep study. He was also set up with cardiology 
follow-up.  He was discharged off the diuretics given the 
hyponatremia and will be continued on Tolvaptan. 
.
#. Encephalopathy: Likely hepatic encephalopathy.  No clear 
localizing symptoms to suggest infectious precipitant. Urine 
culture and blood culture were negative. Insufficient ascites to 
perform paracentesis. Reported compliance with medications at 
home, including lactulose. Symptoms improved with titrate 
lactulose and rifaximin to ___ BM daily.
.
#. Anemia. Normocytic. Likely multifactorial, but never fully 
evaluated (no Fe studies, Folate/B12/TSH wnl recently). Will 
likely need EGD and Colonoscopy at some point for further 
evaluation.
.
#. HCV Cirrhosis. Hx of decompensation, now w/ evidence of 
enceophalopathy. LFTs and bili stable. Cr at 0.9. No PVT on last 
US w/ similar presentation, thus limited utility in this case.

PORTABLE RENAL ULTRASOUND: 
  
Grayscale and color Doppler sonographic images were obtained 
that demonstrate 
the right kidney to measure 10.8 cm pole to pole and the left 
10.3 without 
evidence for hydronephrosis, nephrolithiasis, or renal mass. On 
the right 
main renal artery demonstrates flow velocity between 71 and 87 
cm/sec and 
resistive index measured at 0.85 and 0.76. Infrarenally, the 
upper, mid, and 
lower velocities are measured at 76, 62 and 103 cm/sec and the 
resistive 
indices 0.79, 0.77 and 0.80. Right renal venous flow is normal. 
On the left, 
the main renal artery velocity is measured at 200 and 166 
cm/sec, with 
resistive index at 0.88 and 0.87. The interlobar velocities are 
measured in 
the upper, mid and lower pole at 83, 56 and approximately 40 
cm/sec. Resistive 
indices are measured at 0.84, 0.71, and 0.70. A Foley catheter 
is demonstrated 
within the decompressed bladder. 
  
IMPRESSION: 
1. No sonographic evidence for hydronephrosis, left 
nephrolithiasis, or renal 
mass. 
  
2. Normal arterial and venous flow demonstrated at the right 
kidney. 
  
3. In this limited portable sonographic study, there are 
elevated velocities 
and elevated RIs demonstrated in the left renal artery 
concerning for 
stenosis. Consider MRA for further evaluation. A non contrast 
MRA examination 
is possible if ___ renal function precludes administration 
of contrast.

Brief Hospital Course:
On ___ ___ underwent coronary artery bypass grafting x4 
(left internal mammary artery grafted to left anterior 
descending artery/Saphenous vein grafted to Obtuse Marginal 
#1/#2/Posterior descending artery) with ___. Cross clamp 
time= 97 minutes/ Cardiopulmonary bypass time= 132 minutes. 
Please refer to ___ report for further 
details. She was transferred to the CVICU hemodynamically stable 
requiring Milrinone to optimize cardiac output. She awoke 
neurologically intact and was extubated on POD#1. She was weaned 
off inotropes. Beta-blockers optimized per Blood Pressure 
tolerance. All lines and drains were discontinued in a timely 
fashion. Psychiatry was consulted for postoperative delirium. 

She continued to progress and on POD# 4 was transferred to the 
step down unit for further monitoring. Her rhythm went into 
rapid atrial fibrillation and was treated with Amiodarone. She 
converted to sinus rhythm, no anticoagulation required. She was 
diuresed for right pleural effusion evident on chest xray. The 
remainder of her postoperative course was essentially 
uncomplicated and on POD# 6 she was cleared for discharge to 
rehab for further strength, endurance and increase in daily 
activities. All follow up appointments were advised. Pt. should 
have a MRA as an outpt. for follow up of possible left renal 
artery stenosis. Please restart metformin when creatinine has 
normalized.

주소 불만 사항: 운동 중 호흡 곤란 또는 야간호흡곤란

수술 내역: 관상 동맥 교환술 x4(좌측내막동맥을 좌측 전방하행동맥에 이식하고 사파노스 정맥은 후경동맥의 ___과 ___로 이식하였다.)

병력 개요: 연령 ___세 여성으로서 알려진 관상동맥질환이 있으며 상태전형 삽관술, 심근증, 최근 두 차례의 만성심부전으로 입원되었다. 운동중 호흐곤란과 야간 호흵곤란을 주소로 하여 심혈관계 검사를 받았다. 카테터화에서 다발성 관상정맥 질환이 확인되었다. 관상 혈관 재도색술을 시행받았다.

 과거 병력: CAD는 이전에 발생한 것으로 증상을 보였으며, 최근에는 두 번의 만성을 겪었다. 최근의 발작적 밤 시간 호흠곤란으로 인하여 심장カテ터화를 시도했다. 심장재도색시술을 받았고, 이후 심장 재도포를 시행받아 현재 상태이다.

 과목: CAD가 있는 상태이며, 최근 심장 부전을 경험하였으며, 심장 기능검사가 필요하다. 당뇨병, 고혈압, 고지혈증 등이 있다. 복강조영술을 통해 조직학적으로 정확하게 판단할 수 있었다. 외래 진찰 기록에서는 잘못된 정보라고 보고하였다. 간염, 신장신체계능력치, 혈당치는 각각 150~250㎎이었다. 경추골절 치료와 같은 다른 요인들에도 영향을 미쳤다.

 가족력: 아버지 사망 낭종으로 사망하였다. 어머니는 심장질환자가 있고 아들은 심장부전증 환자였다. 딸은 심장암으로 사망하였으나 생후 몇 달 동안 건강했지만 이후 심각한 심장 문제를 가지고 있었던 것으로 추정된다. 심장이 약해졌다는 것은 사실이고, 심박수가 높아서 심장에 큰 위험이 있다는 것이 밝혀졌다. 심장은 심장판막이나 심장벽돌 등의 이상 소견이 없었으며, 흉곧침은 없었다. 폐렴이 없다고 한다. 심장을 촬영하면 심장의 형태나 구조 등을 알 수 있게 된다. 심낭염이나 기타 비위생적인 현상의 경우에는 심장촬영을 할 때 그 부분을 피해야 한다. 또한 심장사진을 찍으면 심장구조나 심장운동을 파악할 수 있을 것이다. 심액은 심장이 손상되어 심장손상이 있다고 하는데 이는 실제로는 심장 손상이 아니라는 것을 보여준다. 심박수는 심장이 움직이는 속도를 나타낸다. 그리고 심장 사진을 찰 때는 심박수를 측정하는 것이라고 한다. 그러나 심장 촬영상 심장 활동량이나 심박수의 변화를 볼 수 없다. 심리학과에서도 심장 관련 연구를 진행하고 있다. 심리가 안 좋다면 심장문제가 더 악화될 수 있어 심장관련 상담을 받아야 한다. 따라서 심장건강 관리를 위해 심장카테터화를 해야한다. 심미학은 심비대, 심비소, 심백반 등이 있는데 심비대를 제외하고 나머지는 모두 심장기관에 해당되는 기관이다. 심비대의 경우에는 원통 모양의 심장이다. 그리고 모든 심장기능은 심폐합류를 통해서 이루어진다. 따라fore 심장기는 심장순환기능이 중요하며 심장 순환기 능력이 떨어져 심장병이 발생하기 쉽다. 특히 심장교정이 잘 되어있어 심장유전자 유전자를 가진 사람에게 심장 유전자의 역할이 크며 심장결핌증이 많아 심장 결함이 많이 발생한다. 따라히 심장보험 가입률이 높은 편이다. 하지만 심장보험이 많은 이유는 심 장보험 가입자들이 대부분 심장 질홀이 있는 사람들이 때문이라 생각할 수도 있다. 따라한 심 장질홀이 없는 사람은 심장 보험 가입이 적은 편이다.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ old male with hx of poorly controlled DM c/b blindness, 
ESRD s/p renal transplant, CAD s/p stents to the RCA and LCX, 
presenting with chest pain and RUQ abdominal pain.  
 
Active Issues:
# Chest pain/CAD- Pt originally presented with chest pain which 
resolved on admission without therapy. He has a significant 
history of CAD and DM with previous DES to the RCA and Lcirc. 
His last stress test was in ___ without evidence of ischemia. 
Given extensive cardiac history and presentation he was 
monitiored on tele and ruled out for ACS with 3 negative trops 
and an EKG's that were unchanged Pt did not have chest pain 
while in the hospital. He was continued on ASA, plavix, 
atenolol, and isosorbide mononitrate.

# Abdominal Pain: Patient was complaining of pain primarily in 
the RUQ. His abdominal exam was benign exam with mild RUQ 
tenderness on palpation which was reassuring. RUQ US was 
negative for acute cholecystitis but showed a dilated 
gallbladder. Gallbladder HIDA scan was also normal although 
terminated early due to patient discomfort. Pt reported decrease 
in BM suggesting possible component of constipation. He was put 
on a bowel regimen of senna, colace, and miralax and started 
having bowel movements with resolution of symptoms. He tolerated 
PO liquids and his diet was advanced without further abdominal 
pain. He will be discharged on bowel regimen of senna, colace, 
and miralax. We also continued his home ranitidine for 
prevention of GERD. 
 
# ESRD s/p renal transplant in ___. Cr was mildly elevated from 
baseline on admission. After IVF this returned to baseline and 
remained so throughout hospitalization. Pt waa continued on his 
home azathioprine and prednisone. 
 
Chronic Issues:
# Type I diabets: No changes were made to home regimen.

# Hypothyroidism: Stable. Pt was continued on home dose of 
levothyroxine.

# HTN- Well controlled during hospitalization. He was continued 
on his home regimen of diltiazem and atenolol. His BP on 
discharge was 110/62. 
 
# Esophageal spasm: Pt without symptoms. Continued home 
diltiazem. Restarted home viscous lidocaine on discharge.
 
# Hx of MRSA abscesses: Continue minocycline for MRSA ppx

# Anxiety: Continue buspirone 30 mg PO BID  

# Depression: Continue Venlafaxine XR 225 mg PO DAILY

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the surgery service for evaluation 
and treatment following elective toe amputations for dry 
gangrene on both the right and left feet.
 
Neuro: The patient received fentanyl patch, which she comes in 
on from home, with good effect and adequate pain control. When 
tolerating oral intake, the patient was transitioned to oral 
pain medications.  
 
CV:  The patient was stable from a cardiovascular standpoint;  
vital signs were routinely monitored. She was restarted on her 
home dose of coumadin and was not bridged as it was thought that 
for AF she would be able to slowly return to ___ 
state. INR goal ___. 
 
Pulmonary:  The patient was stable from a pulmonary standpoint; 
vital signs were routinely monitored.  Good pulmonary toilet, 
early ambulation and incentive spirometry were encouraged 
throughout this hospitalization.  
 
GI/GU/FEN: 
Post operatively, the patient was made NPO with IVF.  
The patient's diet was advanced when appropriate, which was 
tolerated well.  
The patient's intake and output were closely monitored, and IVF 
were adjusted when necessary.  The patient's electrolytes were 
routinely followed during this hospitalization, and repleted 
when necessary.  
 
ID: The patient's white blood count and fever curves were 
closely watched for signs of infection. Her feet looked well 
throughout with minimal drainage. ___ as started on a 10 day 
total course of antibiotics that is due to end by .........
 
Endocrine:  The patient's blood sugar was monitored throughout 
this stay; insulin dosing was adjusted accordingly. 
 
Hematology:  The patient's complete blood count was examined 
routinely; no transfusions were required during this stay. She 
was restarted on her home coumadin dosing on ___. Her  INR 
was followed and it was thought that she did not require a 
bridge.
 
Prophylaxis:  The patient received subcutaneous heparin during 
this stay, and was encouraged to get up and ambulate as early as 
possible.  
 
At the time of discharge, the patient was doing well, afebrile 
with stable vital signs.  The patient was tolerating a regular 
diet, ambulating, voiding without assistance, and pain was well 
controlled. Physical therapy was working the patient and felt 
that a rehab faiclity was the safest way to proceed to get the 
patient ready prior to returning home.

MRI ___
FINDINGS:
The study is somewhatlimited by motion artifact. Alignment of 
the lumbar spine is normal.  The conus medullaris ends at L1.  
The patient is status post laminectomy and fusion from L4-S1.  
There are postoperative changes at these levels.  Otherwise, 
vertebral body and intervertebral disc signal intensity appears 
normal.  There is no evidence of significant encroachment on the 
thecal sac.
 .
Artifacts from the fusion hardware compromise images of the 
neural foramina at L4-5 and L5-S1.  However, there is no 
evidence of nerve root compression, foraminal narrowing, or 
thecal sac compromise.  There is expected postoperative 
enhancement, with no evidence of infection.
 .
IMPRESSION:
 
Technically limited study due to motion artifact.  Status post 
laminectomy and fusion L4-S1.  No evidence of conus medullaris 
or thecal sac compression.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ h/o cervical + lumbar lami-fusion presenting s/p 
sacral/lumbar trauma with right leg weakness/numbness and 
urinary incontinence concerning for conus medullaris syndrome 
but with MRI L-spine negative x2 for conus/cauda/cord 
compression. He was diagnosed with a CONUS MEDULLARIS CONTUSION, 
the pain and weakness from which resolved during his 
hospitalization. The day after admission, his urinary symptoms 
normalized and did not recur.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES
# CONUS MEDULLARIS CONTUSION: The patient had severe pain and 
weakness of the right leg along with urinary incontinence after 
sliding down a flight of stairs on his buttocks. There was 
concern for conus medullaris syndrome but MRI was negative x2 
for conus/cauda pathology. The day after admission, his urinary 
symptoms normalized and did not recur. His pain and weakness 
improved slowly. He was eventually able to mobilize himself with 
crutches. His pain requirements were substantial and he required 
standing gabapentin (3600mg total daily dose) and oxycontin 
(80mg BID) with hydromorphone PO 4mg q4:PRN breakthrough pain. 
While in house, he also received frequent IV Dilaudid, reaching 
doses as high as 2.125mg q3h. He was given a prescription for 
outpatient physical therapy.
.
# DM1: Asymptomatic, sugars above goal on admission. His 
metformin was held while in house. Lantus was increased from 20 
to 22 and then to 25. His sugars remained high, often in the 
200s and 300s. He was sent home on his metformin with Lantus 25 
HS and his pre-admission Humalog sliding scale. 
.
INACTIVE ISSUES
NONE
.
TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
# CONUS MEDULLARIS CONTUSION: Followed for increased mobility, 
continued absence of bowel/bladder symptoms. Wean analgesics as 
possible.

History of Present Illness:
This is a a ___ with history of CAD s/p CABG in ___, CHF (EF 
30%) DM, NSVT s/p ICD, pAF on coumadin, CVA in ___ who 
presents for direct admission for cath. In ___, patient 
presented in ___ with chest pain and was found to have NSTEMI 
which was reportedly treated medically. Since then, he reports 
several episodes of chest pain, for which an ETT was scheduled. 
Two days prior to admission, patietn had 2 further episodes of 
chest pain, one of which awoke the patient up from sleep. Both 
episodes were relieved with SLNG. Of note patient received a 
steroid knee injection on ___ (day prior to chest pain 
episodes). Given his pain, he contacted his cardiologist who 
recommended bypassing ETT and admission for cath. Given his 
recent stroke, it was thought that he should be bridged with 
heparin while his INR falls to subtherapeutic level.

IMAGING:
============
ECHO (___):
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric 
left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is 
moderately dilated. There is severe regional left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction with inferior and inferolateral thinning 
and akinesis. There is moderate to severe hypokinesis of the 
remaining segments (LVEF = ___. No masses or thrombi are 
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue synchronization imaging 
demonstrates significant left ventricular dyssynchrony, because 
of inferolateral akinesis. The delay between left ventricular 
and right ventricular ejection is 13 ms ___ <40ms). The left 
ventricle is dyssnchronous with global synchrony (___) index of 
60 ms ___ <=33ms), although the most dyssynchronous segment 
(inferolateral wall) is also the one which appears thin and 
fibrotic. Right ventricle is mildly dilated and hypokinetic. The 
diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are 
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but 
aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve leaflets are 
structurally normal. The mitral valve leaflets do not fully 
coapt. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The left 
ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling 
abnormality, with elevated left atrial pressure. Moderate to 
severe [3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and 
global left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Significant 
intraventricular LV dyssynchrony, however late segments are also 
likely scarred. Moderate functional mitral regurgitation. 
Moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary 
hypertension.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, LV 
cavity has further dilated, LV systolic function is reduced. 
Severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has increased

CXR (___):
FINDINGS:  There is stable cardiomegaly.  Dual-lead left-sided 
pacemaker is in adequate position with leads terminating in the 
right atrium and right ventricle.  As compared to prior chest 
radiograph from ___, there is an increased area of 
opacity in the right lung base with obscuration of the medial 
right hemidiaphragm.  In the appropriate clinical setting, this 
could reflect early pneumonia. There is congestion of the upper 
lobes. There is no definite pneumothorax or pleural effusions.   

IMPRESSION:  Increased opacity at right lung base with 
obscuration of the 
medial right hemidiaphragm. In the appropriate clinical setting, 
this could represent early pneumonia.  Clinical correlation is 
recommended.

cardioversion, a.fib being amio loaded.
.
ACTIVE ISSUES:
============================
# Acute on chronic congestive heart failure with 
diastolic/systolic dysfunction: EF 30% in ___. After his cath, 
echo showed EF during this admission showed EF ___. The day 
after cardiac cath the patient was noted to be in acute on 
chronic CHF with an elevated, bibasilar crackles without 
significant edema thought to be secondary to NSTEMI. He was 
transferred to the CCU and started on Lasix gtt 10mg/hr and 
required additional dose of metalozone. His urine output 
improved with increasing furosemide dose to 15mg/hr. His 
spironolactone was stopped in the CCU. When the patient appeared 
to be close to euvolemia he switched to torsemide 60mg daily and 
was discharged on this dose. No admission 91.6 kg was his 
maximum weight and discharge weight was 88.0 kg. 
.
# NSTEMI: Given the patient's history of stroke in ___, he 
was admitted for heparin bridging prior to cardiac 
catheterization. He underwent cardiac catheterization on ___ 
without intervention, which was complicated by wire dissection. 
Day after cardiac cath, he developed on going chest 
pain/pressure, diaphoresis and SOB. Cardiac enzymes continued to 
trend upward with a peak of CK-MB 45 and troponin of 1.49. His 
troponin remained elevated beyond when his CK-MB trended 
downwards given his underlying renal failure. At that point, it 
was determined to medically manage the patient with the addition 
of imdur 30mg daily, metoprolol 50mg daily, atorvastatin, and 
full dose aspirin. Given his recent stroke, neurology was 
consulted in regards to dual anti-platelet in addition to 
coumadin given increased risk of bleeding. It was recommended 
that he stay on full dose aspirin and coumadin. His chest pain 
resolved by admission. 
.
# Paroxysmal Afib: Patient was initially admitted prior to 
catheterization for heparin bridging given that he had a CVA in 
___ and there was concern that his recent CVA was secondary 
to embolic event. CHADS2 score was 6. His precath course was 
complicated by one episode of afib with RVR. He was then started 
on amiodarone and was loaded with amiodarone 400mg BID for a 
total of 8g and switched to amiodarone 400mg daily thereafter 
for an additional month. He was rate controlled with metoprolol 
succinate 50mg daily. After cath, he was bridged to coumadin 
with heparin gtt as renal function precluded the use of 
enoxaparin for bridging. After return to the floor from the CCU, 
he did not have any episodes of a.fib with rvr. As per the 
patient, his INR is managed by his PCP and should have next INR 
drawn on ___.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.4-1.6. After 
cardiac catheterization and while the patient was in the CCU he 
was noted to have low UOP and an increase in his creatinine with 
a peak of 3.5. Renal was consulted by CCU team and thought to be 
secondary to pre-renal etiology despite being hypervolemic on 
exam at that time and most likely had vasoconstriction from 
contrast dye as timing was too soon to have developed contrast 
nephropathy. His creatinine improved with diuresis (see above 
for further details). His losartan was initially held in the 
setting of renal failure, but was restarted prior to discharge. 
His discahrge cr was 2.2, which appears to be his new baseline. 
He should follow up with nephrology as an outpatient.
.
# Ventricular Tachycardia: ICD placed in ___ for primary 
prevention and underwent generator change in ___. While the 
patient was in the CCU, he was intermittently with episodes of 
VTach with rates up to 160s-170s symptomatic only with 
dizziness. The patient sustained in VT for >20minutes and was 
subsequently cardioverted on ___. His ICD was interrogated the 
day after by EP and was determined to be functioning properly. 
He was monitored on telemetry after he returned to the floor 
without episodes of VT.
.
# Leukocytosis: Peak WBC 16.8 without any localizing signs of 
symptoms for infection and he remained afebrile throughout his 
course. Urine and blood cultures were negative. CXR was 
consistent with pulmonary edema. Leukocytosis was most likely 
from stress reaction and had resolved by discharge at the time 
his WBC was 9.0 
.
# DM: At home, patient is maintained on combination of oral 
hypoglycemics and insulin. Also of note, patient persistently 
symtpomatically hypoglycemic in AM with home dose of insulin in 
the intensive care unit most likely combination of poor po 
intake and worsening renal function. His insulin was adjusted, 
so dose of nighttime long acting insulin was halved to 15 units 
on day of transfer to the floor. The patient was then 
transitioned back to his home dosing of insulin prior to 
discharge without any episodes of hypoglycemia.
.
# CVA: Given his recent stroke in ___ with only deficit word 
finding difficulties at times, neurology was consulted in 
regards to dual anti-platelet in addition to coumadin given 
increased risk of bleeding. It was recommended that he stay on 
full dose aspirin and coumadin.
.
# Hematuria: While on the heparin gtt, the patient had his foley 
removed and developed one day of hematuria that resolved the 
next day. His hematocrit remained stable with discharge Hct of 
36.4.
.
CHRONIC ISSUES:
===========================
# HLD: continued on atorvastatin.

# BPH: continued on doxazosin.

# OSA: Patient refused capap during hospitalization. He was 
maintained on continuous O2 monitoring.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
==========================
# Code: Full
# Restarting spironolactone as outpatient
# Establish care with nephrologist

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you here at ___ 
___.

You came to the hospital because you were having chest pain and 
underwent cardiac catheterization that was unable to intervene 
upon the lesion, but it did cause an injury to the artery. 
Afterwards, you had trouble breathing and were transferred to 
intensive care unit. You needed to have fluid from your legs and 
around your lungs and your breathing improved thereafter. We 
were able to do this with furosemide and your symptoms improved.

As you go forward, it is important to weigh yourself every 
morning, call your primary care physician or cardiologist if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

You were also found to have an irregular heart rate in the 
intensive care unit called ventricular tachycardia and you had 
to be shocked out of this rhythm.

In regards to your atrial fibrillation, you were on a heparin to 
keep you blood thin while we waited for your INR from your 
coumadin to be therapeutic between ___. Since amiodarone 
enhances the effect of coumadin (warfarin), you most likely will 
need less coumadin than previously.

While here, you were found to have slightly worsening kidney 
function and should follow up with a cardiologist.

The following changes were made to your medications:
--START amiodarone 400mg daily
--START torsemide 60mg daily
--START isosorbide mononitrate 30mg daily
--START warfarin 3mg daily, until you have your next INR checked 
and your pcp ___ adjust the dose from there.
--START Metoprolol 50mg daily
--STOP carvedilol
--STOP spironolactone
--STOP furosemide (it is being replaced with torsemide)

History of Present Illness:
___ woman with a history of COPD s/p trach and reversal 
on intermittent home O2, seizure disorder, and prior CVA who 
presents with hypoxia and difficulty speaking. 

Per her SNF, she was noted to be lethargic and hypoxic to the 
___, prompting her to be brought to the ED. The patient is 
unsure exactly why she was brought to the hospital, but says it 
is due to being sleepy and unable to eat breakfast at her SNF. 
She reports taking her oxycodone at 4AM instead of her usual 
midnight dose. She denies any recent illnesses or symptoms of 
fever/chills, myalgias/arthalgias, dysuria, increased diarrhea, 
or worsening cough/sputum. She is complaining of chronic back 
pain. She denies chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain or 
nausea/vomiting. She also was complaining of difficulty speaking 
with slurring of her words, which has never happened before. Her 
other neurologic deficits (lower extremity weakness and right 
arm incoordination) are at baseline.  

In the ED, she was hypoxic to the mid-80s on nasal cannula and 
was started on BiPAP. Her CXR was concerning of pulmonary edema 
and she was given 40 mg IV Lasix. She was noted to be 
hyperkalemic and was given calcium, insulin and dextrose.   

She was recently admitted from ___ for hypoxia requiring 
intubation thought to be secondary to pneumonia and COPD 
exacerbation. During that admission, she presented with hypoxia 
to 60% on RA and was intubated after failing a trial of BiPAP. 
She had severe hypercarbia and a primary respiratory acidosis. 
Her sputum grew Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenza. 
She was treated for suspected CAP/COPD exacerbation with 
ceftriaxone, azithromycin, steroids, and bronchodilators. Her 
course was also complicated by hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia in the

and hyperkalemia. 

___ HOSPITAL COURSE
====================
#Acute on chronic hypercarbic/hypoxemic respiratory failure 
#Acute on chronic diastolic CHF
#Aspiration and COPD
Patient presented with acute on chronic hypercarbic/hypoxemic 
respiratory failure in the setting of re-timing her opiate 
medications and reported sedation. Differential diagnoses 
include COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, CHF exacerbation, and 
sedative medication effect.  History and exam was not entirely 
consistent with COPD exacerbation and BNP was very elevated.  Pt 
was diursesed and given methylprednisolone in the ED. She was 
started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP 
coverage. Overnight on ___, she had worsening hypercarbia and 
was started on BiPAP in the ICU. Despite aggressive therapy, pt 
developed acute hypoxia possibly secondary to aspiration and was 
intubated for 24hrs. Her respiratory status improved rapidly and 
she was extubated on ___. 
On transfer to the floor, she continued to improve with 
finishing her course of steroids and azithromycin for a possible 
COPD exacerbation.  Pt was continued on night BIPAP at ___ and 
aggressively diuresed for acute on chronic diastolic CHF. Pt was 
7L negative for the hospitalization and current dry weight in 
224lbs.  Pt should continue on Lasix 20mg daily to prevent 
recurrence CHF and nightly BIPAP at ___ to prevent recurrent 
hypercarbic resp failure. We recommend a follow up BMP on ___ 
0ct ___ to ensure stability.

#Hyperkalemia
K elevated to peak of 6.7, unclear etiology, has been high as 
well in the past. No concerning EKG changes. She was given 
insulin/dextrose and calcium. She was placed on a low K diet 
when no longer NPO and her K improved.   Pt is being discharged 
on daily Lasix, please obtain follow up BMP on ___.

#Acute kidney injury
Cr elevated to 1.4 from baseline 0.7; possibly in the setting of 
infection or poor PO intake. Of note, has history of worsened 
___ with diuresis. Nephrotoxins were avoided, urine output was 
monitored and Cr was trended and normalized. 

#Transaminitis
AST/ALT elevated in 100s. Possibly consistent with viral 
syndrome that may have precipitated respiratory decompensation; 
no documented hypotension to cause shock liver or evidence of 
volume overload causing congestive hepatopathy. LFTs downtrended 
and normalized.

#Dysarthria
Patient reported dysarthria in ED but symptoms have now 
resolved. Possibly recrudescence of deficits from prior stroke 
vs. speech difficulty in setting of AMS from hypercarbia. 
Patient has reported history of CVA, not on anticoagulation. She 
was monitored on telemetry for arrhythmia. Her reported 
difficulty speaking improved. 

CHRONIC ISSUES  
=================  
# Chronic pain
Her home Lyrica and oxycodone were initially held in the setting 
of altered mental status and hypercarbia. On the morning of 
___, Lyrica was restarted and oxycodone was titrated up as 
tolerated. Lidocaine patches were also used for back and 
shoulder pain.  Pt was using low dose cyclobenzaprine for muscle 
spasms without sedation.

# Hypothyroidism
Continued home levothyroxine 

# Seizure disorder
Continued home vimpat and keppra 

# Anxiety
Held Ativan with respiratory status. 

# GERD: Continued home pantoprazole.

non-invasive breathing machine called BIPAP to help with 
breathing at night. It is very important that you continue to 
use nightly at home. In addition, you should follow up with a 
pulmonologist to make sure that you get further testing for COPD 
and that you are on all necessary treatment. You also had to be 
intubated briefly because it appeared that you aspirated into 
your lungs, but fortunately this quickly got better and you were 
extubated.

You were treated for volume overload while in the hospital and 
this has also helped your breathing.  It is important to 
continue taking Lasix 20mg daily to prevent recurrence of fluid. 
 The facility will need to check your labs on ___ to make 
sure your kidney's are continuing to tolerate this medication 
well.

It was a pleasure taking care of you!

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of CLL treatment 
naive, fibromuscular dystrophy, hypothyroidism, complex 
neurological history including ""neurologic spells"" with TIA 
along with bipolar vs. depression with psychotic features, 
undergoing outpatient work-up for myasthenia ___, who 
initially presented as a transfer from ___ with acute 
fatigue initially concerning for myasthenic flair, found to have 
clinical hypothyroidism. Was evaluated by endocrinology, found 
to have clinical hypothyroidism with TSH elevated at 33 with 
normal thyroid uptake study thought to be in the setting of 
recent initiation of herbal supplements interacting with her 
home synthroid. She was later re-started on her home synthroid 
dosage unchanged with instructions to discontinue her herbal 
supplements. Given her ongoing fatigue, intermittent shortness 
of breath and ptosis, was evaluated by neurology underwent an 
EMG as part of her myasthenia ___ work-up which was negative. 


ACUTE ISSUES
==================
# Hypothyroidism - History of Hashimoto thyroidis maintained on 
levothyroxine 225mcg daily, who presented with acute 2 day 
history of fatigue, in the setting of weight gain and 
constipation. She reported adherence to her synthroid ___, 
however recently started taking weight loss supplements 
including apple cider vinegar and garcinia cambogia 1 week 
prior. Per review of partners records, documented to have normal 
TSH, elevated TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies one month prior 
previously stable on synthroid ___ daily. TSH found to be 
elevated at 33. Thyroid US showed evidence of thyroiditis and 
thyroid uptake study was normal. Her fatigue was likely 
secondary to clinical hypothyroidism, also may be multifactorial 
component with possible progression of non-hodgkin lymphoma 
versus myasthenia ___ considered. Endocrine was consulted, 
she had a thyroid uptake study which showed normal absorption. 
Per endocrine taking her herbal supplements for 1 week can cause 
almost complete lack of absorption leading to her clinical 
hypothyroidism. She was therefore continued on her home regimen 
without dosage adjustments with plan to repeat TSH in ___ weeks. 
Per patient request was provided list of ___ 
Endocrinologists who she would like to establish care with. 
Outpatient ___ labs ordered will need to obtain them 1 week 
prior to her appointment in 6 weeks.

___ has had intermittent aphasia, symptoms 
consistent with dystonia, ""neurologic spells"" for upwards of ___ 
years without ever a clear diagnosis. She has been undergoing an 
extensive work-up for myasthenia ___ in the outpatient 
setting given her history of intermittent shortness of breath, 
weakness, and ptosis. During hospitalization, was evaluated by 
neurology here. She had a CT Head with no acute intracranial 
abnormalities. Also underwent EMG testing which was normal 
without evidence of fatigability or myasthenia ___. She was 
continued on ASA 81mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg daily. 

___ - In the setting of an episode of hypotension on the 
morning of ___ with an SBP in the ___, the patient was 
noted to have an elevated creatinine up-trended to 1.3. She was 
asymptomatic and was given 500cc of NS with her Cr subsequently 
down-trending to 1.0. 

___ course was complicated by brief 
hypotension SBP ___ of unclear etiology also with elevated Cr 
per above that was fluid responsive. Possibly in the setting of 
poor PO intake. There were no infectious signs or symptoms, 
patient was not septic. Her home anti-hypertensives losartan 
100mg daily, lisinopril 20mg daily, and metoprolol 25mg daily 
were initially held. On discharge, was re-started on home 
metoprolol 25mg daily, losartan and lisinopril were held. Will 
make transitional issue to consider re-starting ___ if 
hypertensive in outpatient setting.

#HTN - With history of celiac artery dissection and aneurysm 
involving the celiac artery and mildly ectatic right common 
iliac artery, with goal SBP <160. Per above her 
anti-hypertensies were initially held given ___ and brief

diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction, however on recent MRI Head 
Neck ___ at ___ no imaging evidence of vocal cord 
paralysis or mass. She was also previously evaluated by SLP 
found to have abnormal swallow study with progressive oral stage 
weakness with laryngeal penetration and reduced esophageal 
clearance also prompting outpatient work-up of myasthenia vs. 
other neuromuscular disease. She was seen by SLP here during 
hospitalization found to not have concern for aspiration or 
changes in respiratory status observed. Per their 
recommendations was continued on regular solids and thin 
liquids. Will defer to ongoing outpatient work-up if indicated.

IMAGING:
=========================
From OSH
___ portable CXR on admission: WETREAD No definite 
pneumothorax. Multiple opacities project over the right upper 
and mid lung, likely representing known lung mass and possible 
chest wall mass; correlation with dedicated imaging recommended. 
Small to moderate right pleural effusion and small left pleural 
effusion with adjacent atelectasis. Right IJ with tip in the mid 
SVC. 

___ CT chest w/o contrast: 5.4x4.3x5.2 macro lobulated mass 
in right upper lung, extensive adenopathy, 12mm satellite lesion 
posteriorly, 3.6x2.0x6.0cm mass soft tissue in right lateral 
chest wall, 2.3x1.1 cm low attenuation mass in right lobe of 
liver. Mild fullness of adrenal glands.

___ TTE: EF 60-65%, normal LV thickness and wall motion. 
Normal atria and right ventricle, large pericardial effusion 
located near right ventricle.

From ___
___ bilateral upper and lower extremity US with doppler
NEGATIVE FOR DVT

___ TTE
Conclusions  
The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal 
hypokinesis of the apical free wall. with depressed free wall 
contractility. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No masses or 
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but cannot be fully 
excluded due to suboptimal image quality. The mitral valve 
leaflets are mildly thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen 
on the mitral valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to 
suboptimal image quality. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. 
The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild 
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial 
effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Suboptimal image quality 
due to body habitus. Left ventricular systolic function is 
probably normal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be 
excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen - the mid to 
distal free wall of the right ventricle is hypokinetic. No 
echocardiographic evidence of endocarditis. If clinically 
indicated, a transesophageal echocardiogram may better assess 
for valvular vegetations.   

___ CXR: As compared to the previous radiograph, no relevant 
change is seen in appearance of the cardiac silhouette and of 
the right-sided pigtail catheter. Also, the right upper lobe 
mass with mediastinal lymph node enlargement is constant in 
appearance.  No new parenchymal opacities are noted.  Mild 
blunting of both the left and the right costophrenic sinus 
persist.  No pneumothorax. 

___ Video swallow: Gross aspiration of nectar thick liquids. 
Penetration with honey and pureed consistencies with risk for 
aspiration. 

___ RUQ US: 1. Sludge-filled gallbladder with a single 
shadowing stone and mildly thickened and edematous gallbladder 
wall. These findings are nonspecific, and if clinical concern 
remains for acute cholecystitis, a HIDA scan could be performed. 
2. Ill-defined hypoechoic areas in the left hepatic lobe are 
incompletely evaluated given the technical limitations of this 
examination, and could represent cysts although solid lesions 
are not excluded. 3. Septated right hepatic lobe cyst. 4. Mild 
perisplenic ascites.

Brief Hospital Course:
___ male smoker w/ PMH HTN, HL who was transferred from 
___ with new diagnosis metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the lung, with lung, chest wall and 
pericardial involvement transferred for hypoxic respitory 
failure found to have highly resistant pseudomonal pneumonia, 
pericardial effusion growing saccharomyces cerevisiae, and 
anasarca.

___ Course:  Mr ___ began developing 
signs/symptoms consistent with a PNA beginning several weeks 
ago. The pt presented to his PCP who prescribed ___ course of PO 
abx (not sure which abx) completed prior to presentation to ___ 
on ___ w/ reports of persistent SOB/Cough (yellow/brown sputum 
production). On presentation to ___, a CXR was completed w/ 
evidence of a RUL mass vs. consolidation. A CT Chest w/ right 
lobulated lung mass w/ smaller adjacent satellite nodules, 
extensive LAD, a right chest wall mass and a pericardial 
effusion. Pt was started on Levofloxacin for a presumed 
post-obstructive PNA. On ___, a thoracentesis of R pleural 
effusion was completed (w/ removal of over 800cc fluid) - no 
microbiology was sent; cytology w/ evidence of adenocarcinoma. A 
pericardiocentesis was also completed w/ removal of 500cc of 
dark fluid; cytology also c/w adenocarcinoma. Pericardiocentesis 
procedure was c/b Afib w/ RVR controlled with Dilt. ECHO 
completed post-procedure w/ EF: 60-65%. A pericardial window was 
completed on ___, sample ultimately growing saccharomyces 
cerevisiae. Sputum culture on ___ w/ ___ w/ GNR, GPC, GPC in 
clusters); culture positive for Pseudomonas (MDR) sensitive to 
Amikacin/Collistan. Pt was started on Amikacin and Vancomycin - 
first dose: ___. He was ultimately transfered to ___ for 
respiratory failure requiring NIPPV. 

# Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Initially admitted to the MICU 
for NIPPV requirement thought to be multifactorial due to 
pseudomonal pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, and 
lung adenocarcinoma. Improved with NIPPV and treatment for each 
as below, as well as nebulizers, aggressive pulmonary toilet and 
chest ___. patient did not require intubation and was gradually 
weaned to 6L NC.

# MDR Pseduomonal pneumonia: Grew from OSH sputum culture on and 
thought to be post obstructive pneumonia caused by the lung 
cancer. MDR Pseudomonas sensitive to Amikacin/Collistan and 
Cefepime (MIC 8). Patient was treated with amikacin (day 1 = ___ 
to ___ and cefepime (day 1 = ___ to ___, with guidance from 
ID consult team. Bilateral pleural effusions were thought to be 
exudative malignant effusions more than parapneumonic. 
Unfortunately, patient experienced toxic effects of amikacin 
with worsening renal function that precluded his continued 
treatment with the antibiotic and MDR pseudomonas was resistant 
to other antibiotic options preventing alternative treatment 
options. Given this, his rising WBC, and his metastatic lung 
cancer, the patient and wife elected to shift goals of care to 
comfort focused care and ___ was discharged the following 
day to inpatient hospice with Care ___ 
___ House in ___, Phone ___, where he can be 
closer to home and where his dog can visit him.

# Metastatic Lung Adenocarcinoma: Newly diagnosed on 
presentation at OSH. Cytology positive in pleural effusions and 
pericardial fluid. RUQ US for elevated LFTs also suspicious for 
liver involvement. Heme/onc was consulted and recommended no 
further work up or treatment at this time given active 
infections.they states patient could be seen as an outpatient 
only if his clinical status stablizes and palliative treatment 
is still in line with his goals of care. Patient and wife coping 
with ___ from palliative care and social work. The above 
events eventually led to patient being DNR/DNI, comfort measures 
only. Bilateral pleural effusions thought to be malignant, had 
bilateral thoracensteses with right chest tube, left pigtail 
(both removed prior to discharge) by interventional pulmonology 
here at ___ with improvement in respiratory status (R>L). 
Effusions were maximally drained just prior to discharge to 
inpatient hospice on ___. Patient was written for dilaudid, 
zofran, and ativan, which he was not requiring in the days prior 
to discharge. His course is expected to be a difficult one going 
forward given his tenuous respiratory status.

# Pericardial effusion: S/p pericardiocentesis at OSH showing 
adenocarcinoma involvement as well as pericardial window. 
Cultures from OSH grew 4+ budding yeast which speciated to 
saccharomyces cerevisiae. Started Micafungin on ___ until ___ 
when goals of care shifted to comfort measures.

# Atrial Fibrillation: Developed s/p pericardial window. Well 
controlled on diltiazem 60mg Q6h. CHADS2 score 2, but 3 if 
anasarca due to CHF. Patient was not initiated on 
anticoagulation given numerous procedures over his hospital 
course and then ultimate change in goals of care.

# Anasarca: Possibly due to ___ or right sided CHF due to 
restrictive pericardial disease, an addition to poor nutritional 
status (ablumin 2.8). Patient was given ensures TID for 
nutrition. Elevated BNP and improvement with diuresis suggestive 
of dCHF. Bilateral upper and lower US neg for DVT. Patient was 
diuresed early in admission, but this was stopped when renal 
function worsened as a result of amikacin toxicity.

# HTN: Home antihypertensives were held during admission, 
patient was given only diltiazem for afib as above.  

# HL: Home statin was discontinued for elevated LFTs.

#  Stage II ulcers (X2) on sacrum: present on admission. 
Frequent turning, would consult obtatined, optimizing nutrition 
status with supplements. Low dose oxycodone for pain 
(hypotension with higher doses).

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: 
- Patient failed video swallow with gross aspiration. Maintained 
on honey thickened liquids and regular diet for patient comfort 
and preference.
- Patient is being transferred to inpatient hospice closer to 
home with Care ___ House in 
___, Phone ___.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure caring for you at ___ 
___. You were admitted because you were having 
trouble breathing that was due to a number of things. You were 
diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer (meaning it has spread to 
other parts of your body), fluid around your lungs which we were 
able to drain, and a pneumonia with a bacteria that was very 
difficult to treat. We tried to treat it with an anitbiotic 
called amikacin, however your body could not tolerate this 
medication and your kidneys began to fail. There were no other 
antibiotics to treat this resistent bacteria. We tried very hard 
to get your breathing well enough to get you home, but you are 
still requiring a lot of support for your breathing and so you 
will be transferred to an inpatient hospice care center near 
your home. We hope this will allow you to be with your family 
and dog more often.

HPI: 
Mr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history notable
for CAD s/p CABG (___) c/b ITP, PAD s/p bilateral stenting,
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), DMII
(diet-controlled) c/b neuropathy, HFpEF, COPD, HTN, HLD (with
prior statin intolerance due to myalgias), CKD III, carotid
stenosis s/p bilateral CEAs, OSA (not tolerating CPAP), and gout
presenting with acute-onset right leg > arm weakness.

Mr. ___ reports feeling ""shaky"" yesterday while walking back to
his bedroom around 16:00; he briefly steadied himself on the 
door
handle of his bedroom, but decided to retire to bed. He
subsequently fell out of bed and had difficulty ""gaining
traction"" to stand, ultimately requiring assistance from his
daughter. He remained in bed as a result for the remainder of 
the
day, and declined ED evaluation despite his family's
recommendations. This morning, around 11:00, his family also
noted the possibility of ""slurred"" speech, and noted that he
continued to have weakness in his right leg > arm, prompting EMS
activation and arrival at ___ for further evaluation.

Notably, Mr. ___ reports similar ___ weakness following
his CABG at ___ earlier this year. His subsequent course was
complicated by intermittent jerking movements of his right leg >
arm, which he also has noted today, which gradually resolved 
over
time and were ascribed to acute-on-chronic kidney disease per 
his
family. He does not recall being told that he had a stroke
following the procedure, though his wife notes that ""an old
lesion"" was noted on his interval head CTs. Of additional note,
Mr. ___ reports not missing recent doses of his warfarin, and
noted his INR to be 1.9 two days prior to presentation.

On review of systems, aside from the above, Mr. ___ and his
family deny recent headaches, dizziness, vision change,
dysarthria, dysphagia, paresthesiae, bowel or bladder
incontinence, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, chest 
discomfort,
abdominal pain, or changes in bowel or bladder habits.

IMAGING:
==========
MRI BRAIN: 
There are 2 small foci of slow diffusion in the subcortical left 
parietal lobe 
medially with subtle corresponding hypointensities on the ADC 
map and FLAIR 
images. 
  
There is no evidence of hemorrhage.  There is a chronic 
infarction in the left 
caudate body and adjacent corona radiata.  The ventricles and 
sulci are 
age-appropriate in size and configuration without mass effect or 
midline 
shift. 
  
Scattered T2 and FLAIR hyperintense foci in the periventricular 
and 
subcortical white matter are nonspecific, but may reflect 
chronic small vessel 
ischemic changes. 
  
There is mild mucosal thickening of the ethmoid and right 
maxillary sinuses.  
The mastoid air cells are clear.  Postsurgical changes of right 
lens 
replacement. 
  
MRA BRAIN: 
There is mild signal and luminal irregularity involving the 
parasellar 
internal carotid arteries and right greater than left M1 
segments.  There is 
also mild signal in luminal irregularity of the bilateral P1 and 
left greater 
than right P2 segments.  Findings likely relate to 
atherosclerotic disease.  
Otherwise, the intracranial vertebral and internal carotid 
arteries 
demonstrate flow signal without evidence of focal stenosis or 
aneurysm 
formation. 
  
MRA NECK: 
 Examination is mildly degraded by motion.  The aortic arch and 
great vessel origins are not included.  The common, internal and 
external carotid arteries 
demonstrate flow signal with no evidence of occlusion.  There is 
no evidence 
of internal carotid artery stenosis by NASCET criteria. 
  
IMPRESSION:   
1. Small foci acute infarction in the subcortical left parietal 
lobe medially. 
2. Chronic infarction in the left caudate body and adjacent 
corona radiata. 
3. Diffuse intracranial atherosclerotic disease. 
4. Grossly patent neck vasculature to the extent visualized with 
no evidence of occlusion. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ right-handed man with history notable for CAD s/p 
CABG (___) c/b ITP, PAD s/p bilateral stenting, paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), DMII
(diet-controlled) c/b neuropathy, HFpEF, COPD, HTN, HLD (with 
prior statin intolerance due to myalgias), CKD III, carotid 
stenosis s/p bilateral CEAs, OSA (not tolerating CPAP), and gout 
presenting with acute-onset right leg > arm weakness. MRI showed 
more likely recrudescence of previous left periventricular/deep 
infarct. MRA did not show definitive fixed or unstable disease 
in this region. Although MRI read also suggested an  acute 
punctate infarct in the subcortical left parietal lobe, upon 
further review there was no ADC correlate and we do not believe 
this represents an acute infarct.  He was also noted to have 
prominent action myoclonus, which had been documented before, 
and had been treated with clonazepam but led to sedation. We 
started 250mg BID of keppra which led to almost immediate 
improvement in his symptoms. He did have several more episodes 
of right hemiparesis, which lasted briefly and did not reveal an 
upper motor neuron weakness. Likely recrudescence, though no 
infectious or toxic source was identified. He did suffer the 
passing of a sister. He did acknowledge significant anxiety. Of 
note, despite the team and ___ recommendations, the patient 
indicated his desire to be discharged home. He understood the 
risks and benefits and ultimately chose to be discharged home 
with services.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

You were admitted to neurology for acute right lower extremity 
weakness. MRI shows that you did not have a new stroke. You were 
noted to have jerking movements with movement (action myoclonus) 
and you were started on Keppra with resolution of symptoms. 

We are changing your medications as follows:  
- Start taking Keppra 250 mg twice a day

Please remember to weigh yourself every morning, call MD if 
weight goes up more than 3 lbs.

Please take your other medications as prescribed.
  
Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician 
as listed below.  

If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek 
emergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical 
Services (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, 
please pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of 
these symptoms:  

 - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  
 - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to 
you  
 - Sudden weakness of one side of the body

의사: ______ _

주민등록번호: 없음           주소: 없음

환자의 상태를 설명하면 다음과 같습니다:

우측 다리와 팔 약화가 있습니다.

수술이나 침습적 절차는 없습니다.

병력은 다음과 같습니다:
신경계 병력이 있으며, 이전에 심근경색증 후 우측 다리가 더 약해졌습니다. 또한, 최근 가족에서 지시받지 않고도 전문의에게 가서 치료 받았으며, 그 결과 현재 우측다리의 운동을 하지 못하고 있습니다. 또한 환자는 지난 밤 잠들 때 오른쪽 다리를 사용하지 않았고, 아침에는 왼손으로 음식을 먹었습니다.

혈액 검사는 다음과 같이 나타났습니다:
현재 혈당 수치가 높아지고 있으나, 이는 당뇨병 때문이라고 합니다. 또한 혈압은 높은 편입니다. 그리고 간염이 있는 것으로 보이며, 이로 인한 위장관 출혈이 발생했습니다.

심각한 증상은 없지만, 과거에 두 차례 이상 뇌졸중을 경험했으며, 이번에도 같은 증상을 보여줍니다. 또한 좌면 부정 감작이 있고, 양팔 모두 움직이지 않습니다. 그리고 발음이 어렵다고 하였습니다.

수업 중에 의사가 방문하여 진단을 내렸는데, 그것은 다음과 같았다:
우측 상완골절과 동반된 손실이 있었던 것처럼 보이고, 특히 우측 상방부위가 불편합니다. 또한 우측 대퇴골절이 있었고, 이러한 상황에서도 우측대퇴골결장이 없었음을 알게 되었습니다. 그리고 우측하퇴골 결장은 없었다.

또한, 우측발목 관절염이 있었으며, 특히 무릎 관절이 아프다는 것을 알게 되었고, 이를 통해 우측 허벅지가 생겼습니다. 그러나 이것은 일회성이 아니며, 계속해서 진행되고 있다고 생각됩니다.

따라서, 우리는 다음의 처치를 권유합니다:
우선 우측허벅지를 조기에 발견하였으므로, 이를 위해 적극적인 치료를 시행할 필요가 있습니다. 그리고 이 과정에서 우측피질종양이 발생하기도 했으며, 이를 통하여 우측척추전문이 생긴 것이 확인되었습니다.
그리고 우측 척추전문을 이용하는 것은 매우 어려운 일이 아닐까 싶었지만, 실제로는 쉽게 해결될 수 있었다고 생각합니다. 따라서, 우석척추 전문이 사라지는 것을 목표로 하는 치료법을 시도해보려고 합니다.

우리는 또한 우석허벵이가 사라져야 한다고 생각하며, 이를 위해서는 우측 피질 종양을 제거해야 할 것입니다. 하지만, 아직까지는 정확한 원인이 밝혀지지 않았다. 따라래서, 우리들은 우석 허벵이를 제거하려는 노력을 기울여보려 하고 있습니다.

우석 허브가 사라졌다면, 우리는 우석 척수를 재건할 수 있을 것이다. 그리고 우리는 우측 체간을 강화시키는 방법을 찾겠다고 생각합니다.

우산을 쓰면서도 우측체간을 유지하면서 걸어볼 수도 있다. 그리고 우리들의 목표는 우석체간이 다시 살아날 수 있도록 하는 것이다. 그러니, 우리는 더욱 힘써 우석 체간의 회복을 도모할 것이다.

우익스텐션을 활용하여 우석첩추를 재건하고, 우선플렉스를 만들어내는 것도 좋은 방법이다. 그리고, 우리는 이러한 방법들을 통해 우석천막을 만들어서 우석 천막을 보호할 것이다. 그렇게 하면 우석역이 사라질 것이다.

그러나, 우식스가 사라지더라도 우석 역이 다시 돌아올 수 있다는 점을 명심하자. 그리고 항상 우석의 안전을 최우선으로 삼도록 하겠다.

우리아이는 우석을 잘 돌보고, 우락분노를 방지하는데 큰 관심을 가지고 있다. 그래서 우석이 건강하게 살 수 있도록 해달라는 부탁이다. 감사한다."

atrial septal defect. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with 
preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. 
Mildly dilated aortic arch. 

If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to assess 
the etiology of the prominent right atrial flow.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ w/Hx of CKD, ___ transferred from ___ 
for new onset atrial flutter.

ACTIVE ISSUES:
============
#Atrial flutter
Patient presented with chills/rigors, with dysuria, noted to be 
in atrial flutter in the outpatient setting, sent in to our ED. 
Patient's atrial flutter felt to be possibly precipitated by a 
UTI, and broke soon after admission with IV dilt and PO dilt, 
transitioned to metoprolol for rate control given history of 
CAD. However, patient noted to be persistently bradycardic on 
telemetry ___, asymptomatic), so metoprolol was downtitrated 
to metoprolol succinate 12.5mg daily, with improved heart rates. 
TSH checked and was normal (2.2). Given CHADS Vasc of 4, was 
bridged with heparin to coumadin for anticoagulation (new 
medication for this patient), and INR on discharge was 2.7 on 
5mg coumadin daily. Given his CKD, patient is not a good 
candidate for novel anticoagulation agents. His plavix was also 
stopped given cardiac stents placed a number of years ago, and 
in the setting of starting coumadin, discussed with outpatient 
cardiologist Dr. ___ was in agreement with coumadin and 
aspirin, and stopping plavix. ___ PCP, ___ to 
monitor INR. Patient was set up with outpatient ___ services for 
home services evaluation and medication reconciliation. Consider 
EP consult/cards follow up for ablation if aflutter recurs in 
future.

ECHO was done this admission given last done ___ years ago, 
LVEF>55%. Some concern for possible ASD, recommend TEE to 
further evaluate. Given no symptoms, no hypoxia, and already 
anticoagulated, deferred to outpatient setting. 

#UTI
Patient with dysuria, rigors/chills, with leukocytosis to 20, 
initially started on IV ceftriaxone, transitioned to PO 
ampicillin once urine cultures grew enterococcus sensitive to 
amp. Plan for 7 day course of ampicillin, last dose morning of 
___. Patient's leukocytosis improving, though still elevated 
by time of discharge, afebrile. Had some loose stool initially, 
improved by time of discharge, but advised patient to call PCP 
if any worsening diarrhea to test for cdiff given antibiotics 
exposure.

#Acute on chronic kidney disease
Patient had AoCKD on admission with Cr to 3.6 from baseline 
1.6-1.8, likely related to UTI and possible cardiac congestion 
from initial aflutter, improved with fluids and treatment of 
UTI, back to baseline by time of discharge. Renal US was done 
which showed enlarged prostate, without evidence of obstruction 
(no hydronephrosis).

CHRONIC ISSUES:
====================
#DM II: Per patient well controlled fsbs at home, usually 100s 
(rarely >200), on NPH 48 units at breakfast, 10 units at 
dinnertime, no sliding scale. Last Hgb A1c on ___ was 6.3 
(similar to prior). FSBS here ranging 56-151. Continued on home 
NPH and humalog sliding scale while inpatient.

#CAD: No ECG changes or clinical symptoms suggestive of active 
ischemia. Follows with atrius cards. Continued home aspirin, 
statin, metop started per above for aflutter, ECHO this 
admission with LVEF >55%.

#Anemia:
No evidence of active bleeding this admission, stool guaiac 
negative x3.  Continued on ferrous sulfate supplementation.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
=======================
# Continue ampicillin 500mg q8 for total 7 day course, last dose 
in AM of ___.
# Started on warfarin 5mg daily for atrial flutter with high 
chads vasc score of 4, INR to be followed by Atrius PCP. 
Recommend next INR check on ___.
# Losartan/HCTZ held on admission in the setting of ___, 
restarted on discharge.
# Amlodipine held on admission as pressures were low-normal in 
the setting of UTI, restarted at time of discharge.
# Patient had intermittent loose stools, improved by discharge. 
Told patient to call PCP if this worsens.
# Consider EP consult/cards follow up for ablation if aflutter 
recurs in future.
# Consider TEE in future given concern for ASD on TTE this 
admission, no concerning symptoms this admission.
# Code: Full (confirmed)
# Emergency Contact: ___. ___
Health Care Proxy = ___ (daughter), 
___ (confirmed on ___ with patient at ___ 
visit)

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. ___,

It was a pleasure taking care of you during your recent hospital 
stay at the ___. You came in 
feeling unwell with painful urination, chills and shakes, and 
were found to have a urinary tract infection, as well as fast 
heart rates likely from this infection. You were given 
antibiotics for your bladder infection, and medications to help 
bring your heart rate back to a normal level. You will continue 
to take your antibiotic at home, last dose will be the morning 
of ___ morning). You were also started on a new 
medication to help control your heart rates, called metoprolol, 
and you will continue taking this medication once in the morning 
every day until you see your cardiologist Dr. ___.  Lastly, 
because with fast heart rates like yours was puts you at risk 
for forming clots, you were started on a blood thinner called 
coumadin to try and prevent blood clots in the future. You will 
continue to take this medication once every day, and you will 
have to get your blood levels checked on a regular basis to 
ensure your blood stays thin. 

Lastly, because we started a new blood thinner medication, 
coumadin, you no longer need to continue your plavix medication, 
as it can increase your risk of bleeding. We spoke with your 
cardiologist Dr. ___ agreed to stop plavix. 

We have also arranged for home nurses to visit to help with 
medication management given all of your new medications. Your 
medications are listed below, along with your future follow up 
appointments. It is very important that you take all your 
medications as directed, especially the coumadin medication, and 
go to all of your follow up appointments to make sure things are 
going well. 

Also, if you have worsening loose stools, please contact your 
doctor immediately. 

We wish you the best with your health.

There are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  There has been 
no significant change. 
IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mild cardiomegaly.  No evidence of acute 
cardiopulmonary disease. 

STRESS ___
This ___ year old morbidly obese woman s/p gastric 
by-pass ___ was referred to the lab for evaluation of atypical 
chest 
discomfort. The patient was infused with 0.142 mg/kg/min of 
dipyridamole over 4 minutes. No arm, neck, back or chest 
discomfort was 
reported by the patient throughout the study. There were no ST 
segment 
changes during the infusion or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus 
with 
no ectopy. Appropriate hemodynamic response to the infusion and 
recovery. The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg of 
aminophylline IV. 
IMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms or ischemic EKG changes. 
Nuclear 
report sent separately. 

PERFUSION ___
INTERPRETATION:  
The image quality is poor due to extensive soft tissue and 
breast attenuation. 
Left ventricular cavity size is normal.. 
Rest and stress perfusion images reveal a reversible, moderate 
reduction in photon counts involving the mid and basal inferior 
and inferoseptal walls. 
Gated images reveal normal wall motion.  
The calculated left ventricular ejection fraction is 53% with an 
EDV of 82 ml.   
IMPRESSION:  
1. Probable reversible, medium sized, moderate severity 
perfusion defect 
involving the RCA territory. 
2. Normal left ventricular cavity size and systolic function. 
Compared with prior study of ___, the defect is probably 
new. 

CARDIAC CATH ___
ESTIMATED blood loss: <50 cc

pain with subsequent positive nuclear stress test now s/p 
cardiac catheterization with no angiographically apparent CAD.  

ACTIVE ISSUES:  

# Chest pain, non-cardiac: Pt presented with chest pain, lower 
extremity edema, and abdominal pain. Her cardiac enzymes were 
negative. She had a cardiac stress test that showed probable 
reversible, medium sized, moderate severity perfusion defect 
involving the RCA territory with normal left ventricular cavity 
size and systolic function. She had a cardiac catheterization 
that showed no angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease.

# ___ swelling: Patient presented initially with lower extremity 
edema. Symptoms subjectively improved per her report after 
receiving a couple doses of IV furosemide 40mg while 
hospitalized. She should follow up with PCP regarding possibly 
restarting her previous home lasix. 

CHRONIC ISSUES:  
# Abdominal pain: She will need to re-schedule her appt with 
Surgery to undergo definitive removal of her skin ulceration. No 
other relevant lab abnormalities or concerning physical exam 
findings to raise concern for other cause of her pain outside of 
this ulceration.  She was continued on her topical clindamycin

History of Present Illness:
___ is a ___ old woman with a history of seizure
disorder on lacosamide and zonisamide and psychosis on clozaril
and haldol who presents from outside hospital after suffering a
seizure in her bathroom. 

Per the patient, she has been getting ""grand mal"" seizures about
4 to 5 times per year, although husband thinks this happens more
like once per year. She thinks the event on ___ was one of
those. 

However, talking to the husband reveals that her spells are much
more frequent, including last ___ in the grocery store where
she had an event with her arm/hand stiffening, and acting
strange. Husband will try to distract her, including trying to
dance with her. Patient will become ""confused"" for awhile, up to
___ hours. When she ""wakes up,"" patient will be told she had a
seizure and she would reply ""I know."" Husband thinks the
frequency of the seizures are increasing over the past couple
months, from 5 per month to almost every weekend (this is when
husband is at home from work and is able to witness these
events). Husband is not sure the patient is taking her
medications as directed. Reports she is sleeping okay, but 
waking
up at night to go to the bathroom over the past month. Has had
some loose stools which improved after patient stopped taking
dairy products.

The event yesterday came on while she was in the bathroom and
trying to stand up, saw lights as per her usual auras, and found
she was ""very shaky"" and saw her arms twitch. She does not
remember anything after this other than waking up the next day 
at
___. EMS records show patient lying on floor, with
incomprehensible speech. Husband thinks there was urinary
incontinence, but was not physically there for the event. Per
discharge summary from OSH, patient was reportedly found down in
the bathroom which precipitated a call to ___ by her husband. 
She
was found to have tongue trauma, as well as possible limited
upward gaze, and sent to ___ for further management. Notably,
vimpat level was 9.9 in ___, at OSH had mild leukocytosis to
12.3 with neutrophilic predominance, Na 145, K 3.6, BUN/Cr
___. UA within normal limits. CT head reportedly normal. 
 
Of note, she has a history of complex partial seizures which are
described (per Dr. ___ ___ note) as ""she became
quiet and stiff, lasting for about one minute, and then she came
out of it and was confused for 45-60 minutes afterward.  During
the confused period, she moved chairs around and folded towels. 
In the past, her postictal behavior would include such behaviors
as taking her clothes off.""  She is on a stable dose of
zonisamide and lacosamide. She has a VNS in place which was last
interrogated on ___. Past EEG in ___ shows ""paroxysmal
bilateral and independent interictal epileptiform discharges 
over
the L>R temporal leads,"" and ""two brief electrographic seizures,
37 seconds to one minute in duration, consisting of diffuse high
amplitude 5 Hz rhythmic activity. Clinically, these are
characterized by oral and bilateral upper and lower extremity
automatisms. Lateralized onset could not be determined for these
two seizures as muscle artifact from the oral automatisms at the
beginning of the seizure obscured the lateralized onset.
Interictally, spike and wave discharges isoelectric at F7/T3 
were
seen which represents potentially epileptogenic cortex.""

Of note, last seen in psychiatry clinic with Dr. ___ on ___,
when the husband was worried about increased paranoia, 
especially
after recently lowering her clozaril to 125 from 150mg. She
refused to increase this dose and Dr. ___ was concerned she
might be worsening in terms of her psychiatric disease.

On neuro ROS, the pt denies headache, loss of vision, blurred
vision, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, lightheadedness,
vertigo. Denies focal weakness. No bowel or bladder incontinence

Patient has a history of refractory epilepsy, and presented with 
concern for increased seizure frequency in setting of increasing 
paranoia, and possibly psychosis. Patient was placed on 
continuous EEG monitoring and started on her home anti-epileptic 
drugs (lacosamide 250 BID, zonisamide 200 TID). She did not have 
any clinical or electrographic seizures throughout monitoring.  

With respect to patient's concurrent delusional disorder, 
patient was seen by Psychiatry to assist with management of 
medications. Of particular concern was that patient was 
self-tapering her Clozapine dose prior to admission, and she 
presented with sedation and increase in delusional thoughts. She 
was taking 125mg QHS instead of the prescribed dose of 150mg QHS 
that was prescribed by outpatient psychiatrist Dr. ___. Per 
recommendations of inpatient psychiatry team, patient's 
clozapine was uptitrated to 150mg QHS. Unfortunately, this 
change only exacerbated patient's sedation.

After re-evaluation by Psychiatry team and discussion with 
husband, there was concern about whether patient would be 
compliant in taking the full dose of 150mg QHS. Given her 
decompensated psychosis and inability to adhere to medication 
recommendations in the community, as well as acute sedation, she 
was determined to meet ___ criteria and warrant an 
inpatient psychiatric hospitalization due to concerns for her to 
care for herself in the community and continue the taper of her 
medications.

Patient was then planned for a cross-taper, off of Clozapine due 
to her inability to tolerate this agent (sedation) and 
transitioned to Invega (Paliperidone), which had a more 
favorable side effect profile and ability to be a long-acting 
formulation. Invega 1mg BID was started on ___. The decision to 
start this drug was made after extensive discussions between 
Epilepsy and Psychiatry teams, due to its potential for this 
medication to lower seizure threshold. Ultimately, it was felt 
that the potential benefit of improved compliance and control of 
delusional thoughts outweighed risks of lowering seizure 
threshold, given that patient did not have any events on cvEEG 
monitoring. 

Patient successfully underwent cross-taper off of Clozapine, on 
to Invega, per psychiatry recommendations. By ___, patient was 
completely off of Clozapine and on Invega 3mg BID.  She had 
improvement in her delusional thoughts (reporting only 
occasional auditory hallucinations), no suicidal or homicidal 
ideation.  She became more alert as well, returning to her 
baseline mental status per her husband. 

There was likely a component of toxic metabolic encephalopathy 
during hospitalization given clinical findings of asterixis and 
waxing and waning mental status. A metabolic workup was sent, 
including ammonia, thyroid studies which returned normal. UA 
revealed asymptomatic bacteruria, not though to be clinically 
significant. Patient's asterixis presented, however her mental 
status improved after being transitioned off of Clozapine on to 
Invega. Her asterixis was likely multifactorial, largely in part 
due to her existing AEDs. 

Patient was evaluated by physical therapy who did not recommend 
any services, as patient was ambulating independently. 

# History of pulmonary sarcoidosis in remission, OSA
Patient did not have any active respiratory complaints. CXR on 
admission negative for any acute processes. 

#GERD: Patient was continued on Omeprazole/ranitidine at home 
doses.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:
- Continue Invega 3mg BID, to follow up with Dr. ___. Follow 
up arranged for next week ___ at 2pm)
- Continue home AEDs as discussed. To follow up with Dr. ___ 
on ___ at 9:30 AM

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. ___,
You were admitted to hospital with concerns for increasing 
seizures and confusion. To evaluate you further, we hooked you 
up to continuous EEG monitoring.  We continued your home 
medications of lacosamide and zonisamide at regular doses.  We 
asked the psychiatry consult team to check to see if you needed 
any changes to your medications. Because the clozapine was 
making you sleepy, we decided to gradually take you off of the 
clozapine and start a new medication called Invega 
(Paliperidone). You were eventually completely off of the 
Clozapine on ___.  You did well when off of the Clozapine, 
becoming more alert and with improvement in your thoughts. 
Moving forward, it will be important that you follow up closely 
with the Psychiatry and Neurology doctors.

병력내역 :
수정신장증후군으로서 증상은 주로 경련을 포함하여 매년 약 4~5회 발생하는 것으로 알려졌으나 남편은 이보다 더 자주 발생한다고 생각하고 있다. 최근에 발생한 사건도 그중 하나라고 생각하였다.

임상소견 :
환자는 지난 몇 달 동안의 증가된 경련 빈도를 의심하였으며, 특히 최근 클로자릴을 150㎎에서 125㎎으로 감량했는데 이는 환자가 이를 늘리기를 거부하기 때문이다. 또한 밤에 잠시 깨어서 화장실 가는 것이 많았으며 대변 소변이나 배뇨 불순물이나 체액 분비가 있었다. 다만 최근에는 우유제품 섭취를 중단함으로써 대변 변비가 호전되었다.

최근에는 오랜 기간 동안의 치료 후에도 아직까지 정신적 병력이 지속되어 있으며, 심지어는 일부 환자의 경우에는 정신 상태가 악화되는 경우도 있어 조기에 적절한 처치가 필요하다. 따라서 이번 입원에서도 이러한 점들을 고려하여 치료를 진행할 것이다.

Radiology
---------
CXR ___:  
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
evidence of healing bilateral rib lesions.  No pneumonia, no
pulmonary edema.  No lung nodules or masses. Unchanged 
appearance
of the cardiac silhouette and of the hilar structures. Mild
elongation of the descending aorta. 
 
RIB FILM ___:

Abnormal appearance of the right fifth rib laterally, more
superior in position than the site of patient's discomfort. This
may reflect a myelomatous deposit versus a healing fracture.
 
Localized mottled appearance to the proximal humerus on the 
right
compatible with myelomatous infiltration, new when compared to
the prior study.

HUMERUS X-RAY:  

Findings are suspicious for myelomatous infiltration in the 
proximal right humerus, likely with additional small deposits in 
the remaining humeral shaft. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. ___ is a ___ w/ relapsed/progressive multiple myeloma
s/p auto transplant in ___ on C4D8 Bortezomib and 
Pomalidomide
who presents to clinic for routine visit and found to have
transient hypotension, lesion on humerus seen on rib film. 

#Myeloma Lesion on Humerus: Patient without fracture or 
tenderness on exam.  Did dedicated humerus imaging, which showed 
likely myeloma lesion.  We asked ortho-oncology to review films 
and decision was made for lesion to be managed as outpatient asn 
there was no imminent fractire.  

#URI: Course inconsistent with bacterial infection.  Concerning 
because green consistency but patient afebrile on exam.
- Antihistamine and pseudoephedrine 

#Transient Hypotension: resolved with IVF. 

#Hypercalcemia Improved with IVF. Likely due to MM vs 
dehydration
-- IVF PRN
-- will follow with own dentist regarding TMJ, no need to image 
inpatient as no indication for jaw filma

#CKD IV
-- Cr Stable

#Constipation
-- continued home regimen, be cautious w/ Mg containing products 
due
to CKD IV

#Multiple Myeloma
C4D8 Bortezomib and Pomalidomide 
-- was done as inpatient
-- cont acyclovir for prophylaxis

Chronic Issues:
#Asthma
Well controlled, cont Fluticasone-salmeterol

heparin drip and given aspirin 325 and nitroglycerin before he 
presented. On the floor, he did not have chest pain, shortness 
of breath or other signs associated with an acute coronary 
syndrome. His heparin gtt was stopped upon arrival to the floor. 
His CKs and troponins were flat, although troponins elevated. 
The troponins were likely elevated due to chronic renal 
insufficiency. Nevertheless, the aptient was continued on full 
dose aspirin, lisinopril, valsartan and labetolol.
.
Cardiac biomarkers x 3 were normal and there were no EKG 
changes. His chest discomfort was likely due to a hypovolemic 
state with demand ischemia. The patient has been having liters 
of fluid removed from dialysis and this lower volume of fluid 
could have precipitated his lightheadedness and cardiac 
symptoms. The patient was observed overnight without chest pain.
.
# Nausea: The patient presents with ongoing nausea over the last 
couple of weeks. LFTs were normal. The nausea likely relates to 
gastroparesis vs. infectious etiology vs. medication side effect 
vs. uremia. The patient's nausea was controlled with medications 
and he was able to eat dinner, breakfast and lunch.

FINDINGS: The thyroid is unremarkable. Note is made of coronary 
artery 
calcifications.  Otherwise, the heart, pericardium, and great 
vessels appear 
unremarkable. There is no mediastinal, hilar, or axillary 
lymphadenopathy. 
  
Multiple rib fractures are present. There are lateral rib 
fractures of the 
right 3 -6 th.  The right 5th rib is aso fractured posteriorly. 
The fractures 
of the 5th rib are displaced.  There is no pneumothorax. There 
is a small 
right pleural effusion, cannot exclude a tiny hemothorax.  There 
is no lung 
consolidation. Lung contusion or laceration cannot be excluded. 
Bibasilar 
atelectasis is present.  
  
There is no compression deformity of the visualized thoracic 
spine. 

___ RIB UNILAT, W/ AP CHEST RIGHT
Six views of the ribcage provided.  There are multiple right rib 

fractures, specifically noted to be mildly displaced involving 
the right 
third, fourth, and fifth ribs along the posterolateral arch.  
There is no 
pneumothorax.  No additional fractures are seen.  Findings are 
better 
appreciated on the CT chest from approximately 30 minutes 
earlier. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ was admitted to the Acute Care Surgery service on 
___ after he sustained a fall at home resulting in right-sided 
rib fractures.  Multiple radiologic exams confirmed no other 
acute head, abdominal or pelvic trauma other than the rib 
fractures.  The patient was admitted to the inpatient ward for 
closer observation.  He was given a regular diet and started on 
his home medications.  Due to his history of ___ and 
___ body dementia, narcotics were minimized, if not avoided, in 
this patient.  He was primarily given non-narcotic analgesics, 
which seemed to control his pain fairly well.  His baseline 
blood counts and metabolic panel were checked and electrolytes 
were repleted as necessary.  Physical therapy evaluated the 
patient and recommended that he be discharged to a ___ 
facility due to the patient's current physical limitations and 
the acute pain secondary to his rib fractures.

On hospital day 2, the patient experienced low urine output 
requiring 1.5 liters of crystalloids.  His urine output 
increased adequately thereafter.  On the day of discharge, the 
patient was urinating approximately 25cc/hr.  The patient's 
creatinine today was 0.7, down from 1 and 1.1 from prior two 
days.  The patient was encouraged to increase his PO intake.

At the time of discharge, Mr. ___ was afebrile, 
hemodynamically stable and hemodynamically stable.  A follow-up 
appointment with ACS has been scheduled with a chest x-ray to be 
done prior to the appointment.

Right 3, 5 posterior rib fractures

 
Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - always.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.

or cane).

 
Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to ___ on 
___ after you fell at home.  On further evaluation, you were 
found to have right 3 - 6 rib fractures.  You were admitted to 
the inpatient ward for pain management and close observation.

You are now being discharged to a rehabilitation facility with 
the following discharge instructions:

You sustained rib fractures which can cause severe pain and 
subsequently cause you to take shallow breaths because of the 
pain. You should take your pain medicine as as directed to stay 
ahead of the pain otherwise you won't be able to take deep 
breaths.  If the pain medication is too sedating, take half the 
dose and notify your physician.

Pneumonia is a complication of rib fractures. In order to 
decrease your risk you must use your incentive spirometer 4 
times every hour while awake. This will help expand the small 
airways in your lungs and assist in coughing up secretions that 
pool in the lungs. 

You will be more comfortable if you use a cough pillow to hold 
against your chest and guard your rib cage while coughing and 
deep breathing.

Symptomatic relief with ice packs or heating pads for short 
periods may ease the pain.

Do NOT smoke.

Return to the ED right away for any acute shortness of breath, 
increased pain or crackling sensation around your rips 
(crepitus).

Narcotic pain medication can cause constipation. Therefore you 
should take a stool softener twice daily and increase your fluid 
and fiber intake if possible.

If your doctor allows, non steriodal ___ drugs are 
very effective in controlling pain (i.e. Ibuprofen, Motrin, 
Advil, Aleve, Naprosyn) but they have their own set of side 
effects so make sure your doctor approves.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is an ___ male with PMH significant for asthma and 
dementia who presents now with imaging, labs and physical exam 
findings consistent with acute asthma exacerbation in setting of 
a RLL PNA and new sepsis presentation.  He had a complicated 
medical course and ultimately it was determined to focus on 
comfort care given the patient's end-stag dementia and chronic 
aspiration. He was discharged to hospice in stable condition.

# Goals of Care:  After a long discussion with the family and 
the palliative care service, it was determined that the family 
would like to focus on comfort given the patient's end-stage 
demetia and chronic aspiration.  Would recommend morphine prn 
for dyspnea or pain with bowel regimen and oxygen or fan as 
needed to control respiratory symptoms.  Additionally, would 
consider scopolamine for control of secretions if clinically 
indicated.  

# Sepsis/Pneumonia:  Patient presented with fevers to 104, 
respiratory rate in 30___, and tachycardic to 130s with systolic 
blood pressures in the 90's.  He was admitted to the ICU and 
treated with intravenous antibiotics and improved.  He was 
transferred to the floor.  He had 2 other episodes of acute 
respiratory worsening requiring ICU transfer and non-invasive 
ventilation.  These were thought to be secondary to aspiration 
of secretions and food.  He completed an 8 day course of 
antibiotics for hospital acquired pneumonia after the second 
acute worsening.  Family meeting and goals of care as above. 

# Chronic Aspiration:  Likely from demetia though speech/swallow 
study was essentially normal.  Given that goal of care is 
comfort, would allow patient to eat and drink if he wants, but 
he does not need to. 
# Acute Renal Failure: On presentation, patient's creatinine was 
1.4 with a peak of 2.1.  Ultimately improved with fluids to 1.7 
without further improvement. 

# Dementia:  End stage, long standing hisotry of Alzhemers.  
Goals of care as above. Patient appears somewhat confused and 
anxious on exam. Would avoid sedating medications. 

# Code Status:  DNR/DNI, confirmed with family.

# Contact: Granddaughter ___: ___ or ___.  
Daughter is at ___.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted on ___ with pneumonia and an infection 
in your blood.  You were initially treated in the intensive care 
unit with IV fluids and antibiotics and you improved.

Because you have end-stage dementia a family meeting was held 
and the decision was made to focus on comfort.  Therefore your 
medication regimen was changed to focus on comfort.  The 
facility you are going to is the nursing home you've been in.  
They will manage your symptoms of shortness of breath or pain 
with medications to reduce those symptoms. 

Additionally, it was determined that you aspirate your saliva 
into your lungs which causes lung damage and shortness of breath 
and may cause infection.  Unfortunately, there is no way to 
prevent this from happening.  

You were started on a medication called Clonidine which is a 
patch.  This is to control your blood pressure because very high 
blood pressure and worsen breathing symptoms. 

It was a pleasure meeting you and participating in your care.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
___ M with stage 4 cholangiocarcinomas with peritoneal mets 
last given cis/gem ___ who is now admitted for epigastric pain.

# Abdominal pain - central/epigastric in abdomen and onset ___ h 
after meals, small bowel spasm related to metastatic impalnts 
are likely, versus gastritis/PUD. CT ___ showed nothing that 
could explain symptoms and neither did RUQ u/s ___ (LFTs 
stable, no fever and no leukocytosis - pt with history of 
cholangitis and biliary obstruction but this was a different 
pain entirely) Pancreatitis is possible given elevated 
lipase/amylase last week but symptoms persisted despite 
normalization of these enzymes and this would be an unusual 
course. Pt was made NPO and did not have further pain. He was 
then started on acid suppression with BID pantoprazole and began 
eating again without pain. Per GI, hyosciamine would be a good 
medication for him to try in the future if he were to develop 
cramping abdominal pain. He was also sent home with po dilaudid 
in case he develops pain that is refractory to oxycodone as it 
was prior to his presentation this time. 

# Neutropenia - afebrile. Holding chemotherapy the day of 
admission (was due for chemo ___ when seen in clinic). Pt has 
not had neutropenia after
chemotherapy before. Neutropenia resolved without growth factor

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for abdominal pain. We think this may be 
related to gastritis or irritaion of the stomach lining or a 
similar process in the first part of the intestine. We started 
an anti acid medicine called pantoprazole. Your pain improved 
after this so it seems most likely this is the cause of your 
symptoms. Take this medication 30 minutes before eating.

If you need pain medication stronger than oxycodone you can use 
the dilaudid.

On arrival, pt was able to answer simple questions. the patient 
denied any ingestion, falls, trauma, f/c, HA, or pain, though 
history likely unreliable.  She did have a bag of meds with her 
all filled on day of admission.

Exam in the ED consistent with agitated delirium writhing around 
in bed. Pupils 3mm symmetric reactive, MM dry, no 
clonus/rigidity. Was given 2mg versed, 20mg IM zyprexa. EKG 
notable for QRS 112 with terminal R in aVR. Per toxicology, 
Terminal R wave has concerning morphology for sodium channel 
blockade. Citalopram in rare instances has been associated with 
sodium channel blockade. Promethazine can cause QTc 
prolongation.

labs notable for: WBC 12.9 (lymph 42.7), Cr 0.9, serum tox 
negative, urine tox pending.

Pt was given 2 amps sodium bicarb, bicarb ggt for ?sodium 
channel toxicitity per toxicology rec in the ED. Repeat EKG 
showed QRS of 105.

On arrival to the MICU, pt was sleepy, awake to sternal rub, 
mumbles, but quickly fell back asleep. She improved quickly with 
respect to mental status and did not require further 
intervention. Toxicology was consulted for concern for 
involuntary exposure (per report, the patient may have been 
date-raped). No significaznt interventions were made given her 
stable clinical status. She was started on prophylaxis for HIV 
which she should continue for a ___t which point she 
should follow up with infectious disease. She was transferred to 
the medical floor for further observation. Her hospital course 
was uncomplicated and her home psychiatric medications and 
methadone were  continued in house. She was somewhat labile and 
explosive during admission, and ultimately demanded to be 
discharged. Social work was also consulted for assistance with 
resources that would be available to her, but the patient was 
not amenable to what was available and asked to leave. Her 
ourpatient psychaitrist who follows her regularly was contacted 
about her admission. She was discharged from the hospital given

Brief Hospital Course:
___ hx of anxiety/depression, self harm here c/o AMS with EKG 
findings concerning for sodium channel blockade.

# ?Ingestion -  QRS of 112 msec. Terminal R wave has concerning 
morphology for sodium channel blockade. Citalopram in rare 
instances has been associated with sodium channel blockade. 
Promethazine can cause QTc prolongation. Her telemetry and EKGs 
were subsequently normal and she was felt to be safe from a 
medical standpoint without further intervention. There was a 
report that she was date-raped, however toxicology came back 
negative for the substances tested for at the ___ 
she declined a rape kit but was placed on HIV prophylaxis which 
she should continue for a 28 day period. She should then 
follow-up with ID.  

# AMS - likely related to intake of psycho-active medications. 
somnlence on arrival to MICU likely ___ versed, 20mg IM 
zyprexa from the ED. appears able to protect her airway. no 
fever or clear source of infection. no gross electrolyte 
abnormalities. serum tox negative. urine tox pending. low 
concern for intracranial infection (no meningimus sign or fever 
on exam).  serum ETOH negative. no signs of trauma on exam. O2 
normal. BS in ED wnl. serum tox negative, as was urine tox.
Initially held clonidine, alprazolam, gabapentin, promethazine 
and restarted them once she was deemed to be clinically stable. 
There was no fever or localizing source of infection and low 
sspicion for intracranial infection. Chemistries grossly wnl. 

# Anxiety/Depression/Social: Initally held clonidine, 
alprazolam, gabapentin, promethazine, citalopram and restarted 
when deemed clinically appropriate. She was emotionally labile 
this admission, and slightly paranoid. She initially declined 
social work consult for resources, thedn accepted a consult; 
however, declined the potential services/ opportunities that 
would have been available to her. Given that these potential 
resources primarily involved psychiatric placement, she 
preferred to save her resources for a time in which she would 
potentially be in more need of them as she is limited in the 
number of days of services she can use by her insurance.

ED에서 초기 혈압은 다음과 같았다.
arrival에 따라 응답할 수 있었으며 식품 섭취, 추락, 외상, f/C, HA 또는 통증을 거부했다. 그러나 역사적으로 신뢰성이 낮다. 그녀는 입원 당일에 모든 약물을 가지고 있었다.

ED에서는 혼란 상태와 관련된 환자가 있었다. 관찰 결과는 다음과 같이 나타났다.
관찰 결과 : QRS는 112이었으며 종결 R파는 나쁜 형태를 가졌다. Cittalopram은 드물게 나트륨 채널 폐쇄와 관련이 있으며 프로메타지네는 QTc 길이를 증가시켰다. Lab 결과는 유방암 12·9(림프 42·7), 크 0·9, 혈청 독성 음성이었다. Urine독성은 아직 확인되지 않았다. Pt는 2amp 사중탄산염, Bicarbonate GGT를 받았으며, 반복적인 EKG는 QRS가 105였다.

MICU에 도착했을 때 잠들었지만 스텐날 루브에 깨워졌으며 빠르게 회복되었다. 그녀에게는 무작위 노출이 있을 가능성이 있으므로 토익스러지는 것이 좋다고 했다. 그러나 그녀의 안정적인 임상 상태 때문에 추가 개입이 필요하지 않았으며, 그녀는 HIV 예방 접종을 시작했고, 감염병으로 이어질 수 있다고 했다. 그녀는 심각한 중재 없이 병실로 옮겨져서 그곳에서 복용해야 한다. 그녀는 집에서 정신 건강 약물과 메테돈을 계속 사용하고 있다. 그녀는 아마도 일요일 밤에 발생한 사건 때문인지 폭발적이고 폭풍 같은 행동을 보였으나 결국에는 요구를 받아냈다. 사회 서비스는 또한 가능한 리소스를 제공하는 데 도움을 주었다. 그러나 환자는 무엇인가를 원치 않아 떠났다. 그녀의 외래 정신科 의사가 연락해 왔다. 그녀는 경찰 보고서는 없었다. 그녀는 POLICE REPORT 파일럿이 아니었다. 그녀는 Narcan 2회 투여받았으나 효과가 없었다. Fingerstick은 106이었다. ED에서 초기 비율은 98 · 5· 78· 126· 75· 19· 96 %였다. Arrival에 따라 환자는 단순 질문에 답할 수 있었다. 환자는 어떤 식품이나 물건, 외상의 흔적이 없었으며, 그러나 그의 역사를 믿을 수 없다는 것을 알렸다. 그는 자신의 약들을 모두 들고 갔다. ED에서의 관찰은 혼란 증세와 관련되어 있었다. 두뇌는 3 mm 균등하게 반응하며, MM은 건조했으며, 근육통이나 rigidity는 없었다. 그는 2MG Versed, 그리고 20 MG IM Zypreza를 받았다. ECG는 QSR 112로 눈에 띌 만큼 특징이 있는데, 이는 나트럼채널폐색에 관한 Morphology를 갖는다. Cittlopram은 희귀 인 경우 Na Channel Blockage와 관련있다. Prometheazine은 QTc lengthening을 초래한다. Lab result는 WBC12· 9(Lymph 42 · 7), CR 0 · 9, Serum Toxin Negative, Urine Toxin Pending이었다. Pt가 2 amp Sodium Bicarb, Bicc Carb GGT을 받았는데, 그것은 Na Channel Toxicity에 대한 것이다. Repeated ECG showed QRS to be 105.

IMAGING/REPORTS
===============
___ Renal US
There is no hydronephrosis, definite stones, or worrisome masses 
bilaterally. Echogenic appearance of the renal cortex is 
concerning for chronic medical renal disease.  The right kidney 
measures 9.7 cm and the left kidney measures 12.3 cm. The 
bladder is mostly decompressed.
IMPRESSION: 
Echogenic appearance of the kidneys concerning for medical renal 
disease.  No hydronephrosis.  Limited evaluation of the bladder 
given decompressed state.

___ CXR:
PA and lateral views of the chest provided.  Low lung volumes.  
Lungs are clear. There is no focal consolidation, effusion, or 
pneumothorax.  There are no signs of congestion or edema.  The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal. Imaged osseous 
structures are intact.  No free air below the right 
hemidiaphragm is seen.  Clips in the right upper quadrant noted.
IMPRESSION: 
No acute intrathoracic process.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old man with a history of IDDM, CAD, gout 
who is found to have acute on chronic renal failure. Nephrology 
was consulted and this was thought to be due to a combination of 
pre-renal etiology from a recent illness on vacation versus AIN 
from unclear antibiotic/treatment regimen. Steroids for possible 
AIN were considered but held due to stable clinical status and 
his kidney function slowly improved with supportive care over 
the course of his hospitalization.

ACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES
===================
# ___ on CKD
Last Cr 3.3 ___ (previously ~2s), up to 8.2 on admission. 
Suspect that he may have had an AIN given WBC casts and possible 
new medication exposure in the ___. There may 
also be a component of prerenal azotemia given improvement in Cr 
with IVF and relatively low urine Na. Uric acid nephropathy also 
possible given elevated serum urate but no crystals on light 
microscopy. ___, RF negative, Leptospira Ab pending on 
discharge. He was given bicarbonate and sevelamer for low 
bicarbonate and high phosphate on admission, but these were held 
on discharge as his renal function returned to its recent 
baseline.

#DM2
On home Insulin regimen, ISS. Having trouble getting a 
glucometer at home. Diabetes educator consulted, will provide 
glucometer and a small supply of test strips today, and also his 
home sliding scale was discontinued, he will follow up in ___ 
___ clinic for continued titration. 

CHRONIC/STABLE ISSUES
=====================
# LFT Abnormalities, resolved
Cholestatic predominant pattern of liver injury on admission. 
DDx includes drug reaction (in setting of ?AIN) or congestive 
hepatopathy given moderate hypervolemia on admission. No focal 
tenderness on exam c/w cholecystitis. LFTs resolved without 
intervention. Found to be Hep B non-immune.

# Polyarticular joint pain (L knee, R elbow)
# Gout
Prior flare in ___, treated with short prednisone taper. Does 
not appear to have an acute gout flare on exam. 
- APAP 650mg q8h PRN
- Held colchicine on discharge due to still slightly elevated 
renal function and already on allopurinol.

# CAD: Continued home ASA and statin.

# HTN: 
- Continued home amlodipine, carvedilol, and atenolol
- Holding lisinopril until PCP/Nephrology follow up

# Anemia: at baseline

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
===================
[] Would repeat BMP within one week to ensure stability / return 
to baseline.
[] Consider restarting lisinopril at follow up, also consider 
increasing this and decreasing/discontinuing carvedilol and 
atenolol give some episodes of sinus bradycardia while 
inpatient.
[] Could restart daily colchicine as long as renal function 
returns to baseline / remains stable, but would consider holding 
it given already on allopurinol and no recent gout flairs.
[] Should have hepatitis B vaccination as was found to be 
non-immune with no prior exposure this admission.
[] See by diabetes educator for re-education about glucometer 
and pens. ISS discontinued due to concern for 
frailty/hypoglycemic events at home. He should continue to 
follow with them in clinic for insulin titration.

Mr. ___ is a ___ year old right handed man with past 
medical history remarkable for frontal lobe epilepsy and 
non-epileptical seizures poorly controlled on Lamictal who was 
recently admitted to ___ for tonic-clonic seizure at his 
assisted living facility in ___ who now presents for

IMAGING:
HEAD CT ___ CODE STROKE PROTOCOL: No acute intracranial 
process. 

HEAD CT ___: There is hypodensity in the right pons not present 
on 
previous exam which could represent an acute infarct. 

ECHO: 
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The estimated right atrial 
pressure is ___ mmHg. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity 
size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF 
>55%). There is mild (non-obstructive) focal hypertrophy of the 
basal septum. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall 
motion are normal. The ascending and descending thoracic aorta 
is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly 
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic 
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly 
thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is 
borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a 
very small circumferential pericardial effusion without evidence 
of hemodynamic compromise.

IMPRESSION: Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild mitral 
regurgitation. Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved 
global and regional biventricular systolic function. No definite 
structural cardiac source of embolism identified.
Compared with the prior report (images not available for review) 
of ___, mild mitral regurgitation and a very small 
circumferential pericardial effusion are now seen.

 
Brief Hospital Course:
___ y/o RHF with HTN who presents with new left sided weakness
facial droop and dysarthria.  ___ did not show any evidence of
bleeding or infaction.  However, her examination is consistent
with a new stroke.

NEURO:
Patient was admitted as code stroke with dense L hemiparesis. 
Not given t-PA because of time of symptom onset. Initial CT, 
CTA/P in ED did not show any acute stroke or vessel pathology. 
Patient was admitted to stroke service. Blood pressure was 
allowed to autoregulate, and home BP medications were initially 
held. Patient was started on full strength ASA and simvastatin. 
Fasting lipid panel and HbA1c were within normal limits. 
Since imaging did show small vessel disease, it was presumed 
that patient had subcortical lacune due to small vessel disease. 
Given patient could likely not tolerate MRI due to back pain and 
age, repeat CT imaging was obtained after 3 days. On repeat CT, 
there was small right medial pontine infarct, which is likely 
affecting the corticospinal tract on the right, causing her 
dense L hemiparesis. 
TTE showed mild valvular disease but no etiology for stroke and 
no significant change from prior.
Her neurologic examination remained stable. She was restarted on 
___ for BP prior to discharge.

RESP:
H/o asthma. Patient continued on home inhalers and chronic 
prednisone. She had no acute respiratory issues. 

ID: Had positive UA. Although she was afebrile with normal WBC 
and no symptoms, she was started on ciprofloxicin which she has 
tolerated in the past, for a 7 day course. 

___: Pt discharged to rehab facility.

Main complaint: Right Lower Quadrant Pain

Major surgical procedure: None

Present illness history: This is a 31-year-old man after liver transplantation in 2019 (follow-up children in 2020), situs inversus, vascular problems such as IVC obstruction and azigos vein stents. He came to our emergency room with progressive onset of right lower quadrant pain and bilateral leg swelling lasting one day. Associated symptoms included nausea, no temperature rise.

Emergency Department Initial Vital Signs: Temperature 97.70%, Heart Rate 78 beats/min., Blood Pressure 120/80 mmHg, Respiratory Rate 18 breaths/min., Oxygen Saturation 95%. Lab results revealed white blood cell counts of 12,500 cells/mm³, hemoglobin 12 g/dL, hematocrit 40%, mean corpuscular volume 90 fL, mean corpuscle hemoglobin concentration 29.50 g/dl, red blood cell distribution width 13.80%. Peripheral smear findings were neutrophils 65.80%, monocytes 7.70% eosinophils 1.50%, basophil 0.80%.

Abdominal computed tomography scan demonstrated enlargement of the right ovaries with multiple fluid-filled cysts. Bilateral Doppler ultrasonography failed to show deep vein thromboses. Hepatic venogram showed no thrombotic lesions. Pelvic examination revealed a large hemorrhagic cyst on the right side with no sign of torsional twisting. Ob/GYN recommended admission to the internal medicine ward for serial examinations and pain management because of various comorbidities. Onward care would be provided according to the wishes of the internal medicines team. There were no active complications identified during his visit to the transplant clinic either.

Upon arrival to Internal Medicine Ward, he remained stable. Minimal abdominal discomfort occurred upon movement. Currently there is no nausea present.

Otherwise, review of systems reveals no febrile illnesses, chilies, vomiting, diarrhea.

Last Updated on ___ year old gentleman with a PMH significant for HCV cirrhosis 
complicated by ___ s/p lobe resection in ___, who presented on 
post-operative day ___ from craniotomy for a subdural hematoma 
with fever, rash, and hypotension.
.
#. Hypotension and Fever: There was immediate concern for sepsis 
on presentation to the ED, although no apparent source was 
isolated and no significant fever was recorded in the hospital 
(had 100.4 on admission to the ED). Sepsis workup was negative 
including CXR, UA, Urine and Blood cultures. Final blood cutlure 
results are still pending. Given recent craniotomy the 
neurosurgery service was consulted and was not concerned for CNS 
infection. A RUQ ultraound was performed that confirmed a 
moderate amount of ascites and patency of the hepatic vessels, 
but the abdomen was not tender and the suspicion for SBP was 
low. Adrenal insuficiency was ruled out per cosyntropin test. 
The patient did receive a dose of Vancomycin and Levofloxacin in 
the ED but none were continued in the ICU as the patient 
remained afebrile and the ICU team's suspicion for infectious 
process was low. The patient recieved a dose of IV steroids in 
the ED and subsequently recieved a 3 day course of Prednisone 
60mg. Dilantin was considered as a possible etiology for his 
presentation, especially given the acute renal failure and 
associated morbilliform rash, as a type IV drug reaction, 
including DRESS, though no eosinophilia was noted on 
differential. Adittionally patient had recently been started on 
Keflex so anaphylactic shock due to allergy to cephalosporins is 
another possibility. Both dilantin and Keflex were discontinued 
and should be avoided in the future.  The patient remained 
afebrile and normotensive during his ICU stay and the day after 
admission was transferred to the oncology service. He remained 
stable on the oncology floor and is now discharged back to rehab 
facility.  
.
#. Acute Renal Failure: Patient was admitted with a serum 
creatinine of 1.2, up from a known baseline of 0.9 to 1 likely 
pre-renal failure in the setting of hypotension. His Cr. on 
discharge was 0.9. Renal functions and electrolytes should be 
followed in the outpatient setting.  
.  
#. Elevated Liver Enzymes: ___ Hepatitis C Cirrhosis and 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Patient failed Interferon and 
Ribavirin in the past. Patient with known multifocal HCC 
recurrence re-confirmed per RUQ ultrasound on this admission.
.
# Metabolic Acidosis: initially normochloremic with slightly 
elevated AG, then hyperchloremic with normal anion gap. Likely 
initially ___ to tissue hypoperfusion given the elevated lactate 
on admission. Lactate was 3.1 on admission and decreased to 1.3. 
Also contributed to by renal failure. Bicarbonate trending up on 
discharge.  
.
# Anemia: at baseline of ___. Had initial drop of Hct 
secondary to rehydration and resolution of Hemmoconcentration, 
Hct back to baseline at discharge. 
.
#. Hypertension: Anti-hypertensives were held in the setting of 
hypotension. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg was restarted on discharge.  
Amlodipine continues to be held on discharge
.
#. Hypothyroid: Patient was continued on Levothyroxine without 
event. Of note patient found to have increased palpable right 
lower thyroid lobe. Further workup of this finding may be 
considered in the out patient setting.
